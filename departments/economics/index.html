<h2>Overview</h2>




<p>Founded in 1903, the Department of Economics at UC Berkeley is well known for the excellence of its teaching and advising, with a strong reputation for producing outstanding PhD graduates as well as rigorous and innovative economic research. In recent years, Berkeley economics PhDs have been hired at many other leading institutions, including Harvard, MIT, Yale, the U.S. Federal Reserve, and the World Bank. The department is also consistently ranked among the world's top research departments. Berkeley faculty have won many <a href="https://www.econ.berkeley.edu/about-us/home/awards#nobel">awards</a> including 5 Nobel Prizes, 5 John Bates Clark Medals, and 21 Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowships (an average of 1 per year since 1995). Berkeley economics faculty and students have done groundbreaking work in economic theory, econometrics, macroeconomics, and all major fields of applied research, and they have served as policymakers at the highest levels, both in the U.S. and abroad.</p>




<a name="libraries"></a>
<h3>Libraries</h3>




<p>The <a href="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/BUSI/">Thomas J. Long Business Library</a> houses the major collection of business administration materials on the UC Berkeley campus. The Long Library's collections emphasize the academic and scholarly aspects of business to support the research and teaching mission of the University. Special strengths of the collection include business ethics; company and business history; corporate finance; corporate social responsibility; entrepreneurship; family business; high-technology industries; innovation and technological change; and nonprofit management. The collection, which spans the physical library, off-site storage in Richmond, and the web, includes over 150,000 books, 1.6 million microforms, and thousands of subscriptions in digital format. A large digital library in the social sciences supports the interdisciplinary research needs of graduate students and faculty.</p>




<p>The <a href="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/math/aboutlibrary/econlab.html">Mathematics Statistics Library</a> maintains a reserve collection of software manuals for the <a href="http://emlab.berkeley.edu/eml/">Econometrics Lab</a>. The books are owned by the Econometrics Lab but circulated by the library on their behalf.</p>

The course provides a survey of economics principles and methods. It covers both microeconomics, the study of consumer choice, firm behavior, and market interaction, and macroeconomics, the study of economic growth, unemployment, and inflation. Special emphasis is placed on the application of economic tools to contemporary economic problems and policies. Economics 2 differs from Economics 1 in that it has an additional hour of lecture per week</span><span class="deschide"> and can thus cover topics in greater depth. It is particularly appropriate for intended economics majors.</span><br/>

The course will analyze the roles of individual incentives, target group objectives and outcomes and how they are impacted by group decision making systems. A group decision making system is a way of making group level decisions. We examine this through the lens of game theory and mechanism design and other complementary analytic approaches. For example, we would examine the impact of having alternative election systems. This course draws primarily from microeconomic</span><span class="deschide"> theory as an anchoring framework to evaluate these systems and individual actions. As with much of behavioral economics where we deal with real complex structures, we borrow from psychology (for behavioral theory) and business and politics (for real world examples).</span><br/>

We will study both antitrust law and antitrust economics. Antitrust law governs the accumulation and exercise of market power. It prohibits both monopolization and agreements in unreasonable restraint of trade such as price fixing. It also prohibits anticompetitive mergers and a variety of specific competition problems such as exclusive dealing or tying arrangements. Deciding what qualifies as &quot;monopolization,&quot; what qualifies as an &quot;unreasonable</span><span class="deschide"> restraint of trade,&quot; what qualifies as &quot;anticompetitive,&quot; and more generally how to interpret the prohibitions of antitrust law invariably involves economic analysis.

We will use both economic theory and empirical evidence to study the varying impacts and incentives created by public policies. An emphasis will be placed on the application of economic tools to policy questions. The course will provide an overview of key research in several policy areas, including inequality and opportunity, the social safety net, education</span><span class="deschide">, criminal justice, tax policy, climate change and the environment, health care, and structural barriers to racial equity.

This course provides an introduction to the analysis of economic inequalities and the interplay between inequality and economic growth. It focuses on three sets of core questions: 1) How does inequality evolve over the path of development? 2) What are the theories that can explain the degree of economic inequalities and its dynamic? 3) How do policies affect inequalities, and what types of policies can foster equitable growth? The course addresses</span><span class="deschide"> these issues from a global and historical perspective: it comprehensively deals with the United States today, but also with inequality in China, India, Latin America, and Europe, as far back as 1700.</span><br/>

Since much of financial econometrics is based on time-series data, we will spend the first three weeks introducing/reviewing basic time-series analysis. The course will then start out by discussing the short-run time-series behaviour of stock prices, and present the evidence on short- and long-run predictability of stock returns. We will continue by discussing cross-sectional models and static equilibrium theory, including (but not limited to) the Capital Asset</span><span class="deschide"> Pricing Model (CAPM) and Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT). The course will then consider intertemporal equilibrium models, including (but not limited to) Arrow-Debreu pricing theory and the consumption-based CAPM.

This course studies the following question:How should policymakers and scholars design and analyze environmental policy in a globalized world where much economic activity and pollution crosses political borders? The course addresses issues including climate change, air and water pollution, deforestation, species extinction, and others. The course also analyzes a variety of ways that countries and regions interact, including trade, foreign direct</span><span class="deschide"> investment, outsourcing, international agreements and treaties, and others. The course also teaches a range of tools used to analyze these issues, including life-cycle(also called environmental footprint) analysis, simple econometrics, environmental market design, non-market valuation, and the data.</span><br/>

This course discusses recent research and policy developments. The core objective is to expose students to different aspects of research in economics. A sequence of five different frontier research topics are studied in depth each semester. Each topic lasts three weeks, during which students will familiarize themselves with cutting-edge economic research and methodology. Students will then develop their own research ideas and write two medium-</span><span class="deschide"> size research papers.</span><br/>

This course presents psychological and experimental economics research demonstrating departures from perfect rationality, self-interest, and other classical assumptions of economics and explores ways that these departures can be mathematically modeled and incorporated into mainstream positive and normative economics.

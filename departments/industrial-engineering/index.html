<h2>Overview</h2>




<p>The Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR) educates students to become highly skilled in the quantitative modeling and analysis of a broad array of systems-level decision problems, such as:</p>




<ul>
	<li>Economic efficiency, productivity, and quality</li>
	<li>The collection and analysis of data using a database and decision-support tools; the comprehensive modeling of uncertainty</li>
	<li>The development and creative use of analytical and computational methods for solving these problems</li>
</ul>




<p>Students obtain the broader skills, background, and knowledge necessary to be effective professionals in a rapidly-changing global economy. The department's mission includes creating knowledge that advances the state of the art in optimization, stochastic modeling and simulation, and the application of these tools to important societal systems.</p>




<p>IEOR students and faculty members are actively engaged in a variety of research projects that have made and continue to make important contributions to both the theory and practice of operations research and industrial engineering. Some of the research areas represented in the IEOR department are the analysis of algorithms, automation and robotics, combinatorics and integer programming, convex optimization, financial engineering, inventory theory, risk analysis, robust optimization, queueing theory, supply chain management, scheduling, and simulation.</p>

This Freshman-level Introductory course will provide an intuitive overview of the fundamental problems addressed and methods in the fields of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research including Constrained Optimization, Human Factors, Data Analytics, Queues and Chains, and Linear Programming. The course will focus on two-dimensional, i.e., bivariate, examples where the problems and methods are amenable to visualization and geometric intuition. The course will discuss</span><span class="deschide"> applications such as dieting, scheduling, and transportation. This course will not require pre-requisites and will present the core concepts in a self-contained manner that is accessible to Freshmen to provide the foundation for future coursework.</span><br/>

<title>South and Southeast Asian Studies</title>


<text>
<![CDATA[  
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Department of South and Southeast Asian Studies offers programs of both undergraduate and graduate instruction in the languages and cultures of South and Southeast Asia. It offers opportunities to explore the rich cultural, social, and religious histories as well as the living contemporary cultures of these areas. The curriculum covers modern cultural history, the classical literary canon, religious literature, folk and popular works, oral traditions and performance media (including recitation, musical and dramatic performance, dance, media, and film), and modern literatures of the colonial and post-colonial period. Students are encouraged to take advantage of the extensive opportunities for interdisciplinary linkages by pursuing courses offered by the South and Southeast Asia faculty in other departments at UC Berkeley. Students are also encouraged to pursue courses and independent readings that will acquaint them with pertinent methods in the various disciplines such as contemporary literary theory, ethnographic theory, historiography, and cultural studies. Appropriate comparative work on Asian and non-Asian cultures is encouraged as well.</p>
<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>One of the world's leading institutes for research and programs on South Asia, the <a href="http://southasia.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Institute for South Asia Studies</a> at UC Berkeley works with faculty members, graduate students, community members, private institutions, and nonprofit organizations to deepen understanding of the region and to create new generations of scholars of South Asia.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://ieas.berkeley.edu/centers/cseas" target="_blank">Center for Southeast Asia Studies (CSEAS)</a> is one of the oldest and most prominent academic centers concerned with Southeast Asia in the United States. CSEAS functions as an administrative base to promote the expansion of Southeast Asian studies on the Berkeley campus by facilitating faculty and graduate research, presenting campus lecture series and cultural programs, organizing public outreach and international conferences, and hosting visitors and scholars from around the world.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://buddhiststudies.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Center for Buddhist Studies</a> oversees a variety of research programs, scholarly events, and outreach activities, often in collaboration with units on and off campus. Activities include a colloquium series, conferences, a visiting scholar program, a film series (with the PFA), the Numata Visiting Professorship, and the International Buddhist Film Festival (with the Buddhist Film Society).</p>
<p>The <a href="http://ieas.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Institute of East Asian Studies (IEAS)</a> is an Organized Research Unit that serves as the focal point for all of UC Berkeley programs related to East Asia and the Pacific. Frequently ranked first in depth and breadth among all such programs in the nation, East Asian Studies at Berkeley is a unique national resource and an invaluable asset for California and the West Coast.</p>

The eleven nation-states that comprise the region of Southeast Asia are defined by their linguistic, cultural, economic, and sociopolitical diversity. One facet that plays a crucial role in binding this region is its environment.

This course offers an advanced introduction to the literary history, cultural norms,<br/>
poetic forms and textual traditions of 17 th  to 19 th  century Southeast Asia through a<br/>
comparative study of three epic poems:  Tum Teav (Cambodia), Khun Chang Khun<br/>
Phaen (Thailand), and Tale of Kieu (Vietnam).  We will explore the dynamics of desire<br/>
and transgression, duty and sacrifice, kinship and kingship, and the interplay between<br/>
folk, court, Buddhist</span><span class="deschide">, Confucian, and Hindu values.  Finally, we will consider the<br/>
contemporary currency and iconic status of these works in Southeast Asia and in<br/>
diaspora; what makes a national canon, and why these epic tales of love, loss and war,<br/>
remain strangers to the west.</span><br/>

This course is an advanced introduction to the major teachings of Indian Buddhism and their philosophical elaborations. We will cover the core tenets attributed to the Buddha, and the later doctrinal and scholastic developments that turned Buddhism into one of the principal philosophical traditions of India. For this we will read select primary sources—in principle, extracts of the scriptures and later treatises—and academic articles and</span><span class="deschide"> book chapters. Rather than offering a broad introductory survey of Buddhist traditions across space and time, this class is geared towards students who are already familiar with the basics of Buddhism and want to deepen their understanding of the principal teachings of Buddhism originating in India.</span><br/>

Through use of computer-based materials, a textbook, and communicative practice, students gain a foundation in &quot;survival&quot; spoken Khmer. This involves memorization of question and answer exchanges in Khmer which students are likely to encounter in modern Cambodia. Topics include greetings, speaking to teachers and</span><span class="deschide"> elders and discussing language learning, talking about family and personal history, and food. Students learn the Khmer alphabet and important sight-words and to read and write simple sentences on everyday topics. Intended for non-native speakers of Khmer with no oral or aural comprehension in the language. Students will also learn important basic behaviors and courtesies necessary for smooth interaction in Khmer society and culture.</span><br/>

Students complete their study of everyday standard Khmer to a &quot;survival&quot; level. While the memorization of vocabulary and common personal exchanges practiced in 1A will make up the majority of material studied, students will have some opportunity to learn to improvise and talk about personal work and research interests in Khmer. Topics include transportation and directions, the world of work, religion, health, and conducting daily</span><span class="deschide"> life in Cambodia. Students learn to read simple authentic texts such as folk tales, personal letters, forms, and roadside signs. Students continue their study of culturally appropriate behavior in the context of Khmer culture, including notions of &quot;saving face&quot; and maintaining social harmony.</span><br/>

Non-native speakers who have completed Beginning Khmer will build spoken proficiency with emphasis on everyday &quot;storytelling&quot; and the expression of emotions, feelings, and opinions. Students will gain experience reading progressively difficult authentic Khmer texts, including folk tales and newspaper articles. Native speakers with family exposure to Khmer will be introduced to the writing system. They will quickly &quot;catch up&quot;</span><span class="deschide"> with non-native classmates who have studied the writing system before. All students will study important patterns and structures in Khmer grammar and morphology, and gain a foundation in formal spoken Khmer, express opinions and positions, form arguments, and learn to discuss a variety of topics with educated Khmer speakers.

Students learn to read roadside signs, scholarly articles, and an entire Khmer novel. Topics include current events in Cambodia, Cambodian history and politics, and a basic overview of traditional Khmer literature. Much of this study will be accomplished by working on projects in groups with other students. One such project will involve the preparation and performance of a play based on sections of the modern Khmer novel students read in</span><span class="deschide"> this course. All students will design and carry out an independent research project on the topic of their choice (which will account for 30% of the final grade), and present their research at the end of the second semester to an audience of their peers, entirely in Khmer.</span><br/>

They will also gain exposure to traditional verse texts, and read, discuss, and undertake group projects based on a variety of modern Khmer short stories. As in the case with Intermediate Khmer, students will also undertake substantial independent study, culminating in a final oral presentation.

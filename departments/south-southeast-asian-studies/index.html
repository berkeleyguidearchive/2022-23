<h2>Overview</h2>




<p>The Department of South and Southeast Asian Studies offers programs of both undergraduate and graduate instruction in the languages and cultures of South and Southeast Asia. It offers opportunities to explore the rich cultural, social, and religious histories as well as the living contemporary cultures of these areas. The curriculum covers modern cultural history, the classical literary canon, religious literature, folk and popular works, oral traditions and performance media (including recitation, musical and dramatic performance, dance, media, and film), and modern literatures of the colonial and post-colonial period. Students are encouraged to take advantage of the extensive opportunities for interdisciplinary linkages by pursuing courses offered by the South and Southeast Asia faculty in other departments at UC Berkeley. Students are also encouraged to pursue courses and independent readings that will acquaint them with pertinent methods in the various disciplines such as contemporary literary theory, ethnographic theory, historiography, and cultural studies. Appropriate comparative work on Asian and non-Asian cultures is encouraged as well.</p>

<h3>Resources</h3>




<p>One of the world's leading institutes for research and programs on South Asia, the <a href="http://southasia.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Institute for South Asia Studies</a> at UC Berkeley works with faculty members, graduate students, community members, private institutions, and nonprofit organizations to deepen understanding of the region and to create new generations of scholars of South Asia.</p>




<p>The <a href="https://ieas.berkeley.edu/centers/cseas" target="_blank">Center for Southeast Asia Studies (CSEAS)</a> is one of the oldest and most prominent academic centers concerned with Southeast Asia in the United States. CSEAS functions as an administrative base to promote the expansion of Southeast Asian studies on the Berkeley campus by facilitating faculty and graduate research, presenting campus lecture series and cultural programs, organizing public outreach and international conferences, and hosting visitors and scholars from around the world.</p>




<p>The <a href="http://buddhiststudies.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Center for Buddhist Studies</a> oversees a variety of research programs, scholarly events, and outreach activities, often in collaboration with units on and off campus. Activities include a colloquium series, conferences, a visiting scholar program, a film series (with the PFA), the Numata Visiting Professorship, and the International Buddhist Film Festival (with the Buddhist Film Society).</p>




<p>The <a href="http://ieas.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Institute of East Asian Studies (IEAS)</a> is an Organized Research Unit that serves as the focal point for all of UC Berkeley programs related to East Asia and the Pacific. Frequently ranked first in depth and breadth among all such programs in the nation, East Asian Studies at Berkeley is a unique national resource and an invaluable asset for California and the West Coast.</p>

The eleven nation-states that comprise the region of Southeast Asia are defined by their linguistic, cultural, economic, and sociopolitical diversity. One facet that plays a crucial role in binding this region is its environment.

poetic forms and textual traditions of 17 th  to 19 th  century Southeast Asia through a<br/>
comparative study of three epic poems:  Tum Teav (Cambodia), Khun Chang Khun<br/>
Phaen (Thailand), and Tale of Kieu (Vietnam).  We will explore the dynamics of desire<br/>
and transgression, duty and sacrifice, kinship and kingship, and the interplay between<br/>
folk, court, Buddhist</span><span class="deschide">, Confucian, and Hindu values.  Finally, we will consider the<br/>
contemporary currency and iconic status of these works in Southeast Asia and in<br/>
diaspora; what makes a national canon, and why these epic tales of love, loss and war,<br/>
remain strangers to the west.</span><br/>

This course is an advanced introduction to the major teachings of Indian Buddhism and their philosophical elaborations. We will cover the core tenets attributed to the Buddha, and the later doctrinal and scholastic developments that turned Buddhism into one of the principal philosophical traditions of India. For this we will read select primary sources—in principle, extracts of the scriptures and later treatises—and academic articles and</span><span class="deschide"> book chapters. Rather than offering a broad introductory survey of Buddhist traditions across space and time, this class is geared towards students who are already familiar with the basics of Buddhism and want to deepen their understanding of the principal teachings of Buddhism originating in India.</span><br/>

This course provides an overview of one of the world's largest and most beloved<br/>
film industries, the popular Hindi cinema produced in Bombay (Mumbai) and consumed around<br/>
the world under the label &quot;Bollywood.&quot; The films and readings range from the post-<br/>
Independence era to the present, with introduction to key films, directors, stars, genres, formal<br/>
techniques, and themes. Our readings and viewings allow us to question and discuss the</span><span class="deschide"> ways<br/>
these films reflect and influence the cultures and society from which they emerge. We shall<br/>
reflect on our own practices of spectatorship and how we consume and label non-western<br/>
cultures and culture industries. Together we'll develop a critical vocabulary to help us analyze<br/>
and critique Hindi cinema.</span><br/>

This course considers the co-option, reinterpretation and dissemination of sacred texts and religious practices in various political and cultural projects in India during the colonial and post-colonial periods. Students will be introduced to religious “reform” movements, cross-cultural debates during the colonial period, and how the concept of a secular state in post-Independence India has shaped and continues to shape religious practice and</span><span class="deschide"> public policy. Important themes include transformations in the role of women, debates around caste and “untouchability”, and religious conversions.

Readings will address how Tibetan funerary rituals work to assist the dying toward this end, and how Buddhist practitioners prepare for this crucial moment through tantric meditation, imaginative rehearsals, and explorations of the dream state.</span><br/>

Provides a command of the basic structures of standard spoken Cambodian and tools for reading and writing elementary texts. Through use of computer-based materials, a textbook, and communicative practice, students gain a foundation in &quot;survival&quot; spoken Khmer. This involves memorization of question and answer exchanges in Khmer which students are likely to encounter in modern Cambodia. Topics include greetings, speaking to teachers and</span><span class="deschide"> elders and discussing language learning, talking about family and personal history, and food. Students learn the Khmer alphabet and important sight-words and to read and write simple sentences on everyday topics. Intended for non-native speakers of Khmer with no oral or aural comprehension in the language. Students will also learn important basic behaviors and courtesies necessary for smooth interaction in Khmer society and culture.</span><br/>

<h2>Overview</h2>




<p>The Department of Ancient Greek and Roman Studies (formerly known as the Department of Classics, now DAGRS) at UC Berkeley is a leading center for studying Greco-Roman antiquity, offering excellent undergraduate and graduate education in language, literature, history, philosophy, religion, and archaeology. It is the intellectual home of a distinguished faculty, superb graduate students, and an extraordinarily talented and diverse group of undergraduates. Our community is also enriched by visiting scholars, including the annual Jane K. Sather Professor of Classical Literature.</p>




<p>The mission of the department has four major components:</p>




<ol>
	<li>To give students across the University access to the literature, history, archaeology, mythology, and philosophy of the ancient Greek and Roman world through an array of undergraduate courses; in these courses, students access ancient writings through English translations. These courses introduce students to significant texts, artifacts, and ideas of the ancient world and put these into their broader historical context. Such study deepens students' understanding of present-day issues by inculcating a sense of historical perspective that takes account of both the differences and the continuities between contemporary and ancient cultures. The department also provides instruction in Greek and Latin, from the beginning to the advanced levels, to undergraduate and graduate students.</li>
	<li>To enable undergraduates to immerse themselves in the language and culture of ancient Greece and Rome through its majors in Ancient Greek and Roman Civilizations, Greek and Latin, and Greek or Latin. These majors equip students with the knowledge and analytical skills they can apply in many areas (e.g., law, politics, business, biosciences, computer science, and media). Our undergraduate programs also provide essential preparation for graduate study in Classics, Archaeology, Comparative Literature, Philosophy, and other fields.</li>
	<li>To train and mentor future scholars and teachers through its top-rated graduate programs in Classics and Classical Archaeology. The Ph.D. program in Classics combines intensive linguistic training in both Greek and Latin with wide-ranging intellectual exploration (including literature, history, archaeology, philosophy, and linguistics). The program in Classical Archaeology comprises the study of the material culture of Ancient Greek, Roman, and related cultures (e.g., Aegean, Etruscan, Punic). The study of material culture teaches students to understand the nature and development of these cultures, drawing on evidence provided by ancient texts, settlement data, architectural remains, craft goods, art objects, and environmental materials.</li>
	<li>Through its faculty appointments, to seek the breadth and excellence that can sustain these three goals. The department encourages individual and collaborative faculty research, intellectual engagement with students at all levels, and effective participation in the administrative and advisory work of the department, the College of Letters and Science, the Academic Senate, the campus, and the whole university.</li>
</ol>




<p>The Department of Ancient Greek and Roman Studies (DAGRS) encourages faculty participation in other programs and cooperation with other departments. It includes several faculty with joint appointments, and it enjoys strong connections with: Art History, Comparative Literature, History, Linguistics, Medieval Studies, Middle Eastern Studies, Philosophy, Religious Studies, Rhetoric, Theater Dance &amp; Performance Studies, the Graduate Group in Ancient History &amp; Mediterranean Archaeology, and the Graduate Theological Union. On-campus, Classics faculty direct the Nemea Center for Classical Archaeology, the Aleshire Center for the Study of Greek Epigraphy, and the Center for the Tebtunis Papyri and are actively involved with the Berkeley Center for the Study of Religion, the Phoebe Apperson Hearst Museum of Anthropology, and the Archaeological Research Facility.</p>

This course will focus on ideas about magic in the Greek and Roman worlds from about 750 BCE through 400 CE. Topics will include witches, holy men, love spells, necromancy, spirits, and mystery religions. We will examine how magic was represented in high literature (by authors like Homer, Ovid, Apuleius, and Lucian). as well as the more practical evidence of curse tablets and the Greek Magical Papyri. Consideration will be given to analyzing the relationship between</span><span class="deschide"> magic, religion, and philosophy. Our goal will be to study the common threads that connect different Greek and Roman magical practices, as well as to understand them in their cultural contexts.</span><br/>

Some of the most recognizable images from ancient Greek and Roman literature are the warriors who stride across battlefields in a blaze of glory. But these heroic images tell only a small part of the story. Warfare influenced almost every aspect of life in these cultures, and not just for those who fought on the battlefield or for political leaders. In this class we will read a variety of literary works that illuminate the experience of warfare and its aftermath</span><span class="deschide"> in ancient Greece and Rome – texts depicting the battlefield, but also the stories of veterans, women at home and in war, enslaved captives and others. While we will focus primarily on literary representations of these experiences, these readings will be placed in broader historical</span><br/>

The ancient Mediterranean world was a world full of gods: from the poems of Homer to the small towns of the Roman empire, we can find people constantly interacting with and thinking about the gods. Myth, ritual, oracles, mystery cults, magic, philosophy: these were all ways that Greeks and Romans engaged with the divine. War, peace, health, sickness, hope, fear: these were some of the reasons for these engagements. This course explores the polytheism of ancient</span><span class="deschide"> Greece and Rome (c.800 BCE to c.200 CE), with close attention to both the ancient literary evidence and the archaeological material from the period. We will seek to understand both the long-term continuities and the important changes in religious life during Mediterranean antiquity.</span><br/>

Religion and literature are two conceptual systems through which people and societies organize disparate experiences into meaningful wholes. In the ancient pagan societies of Greece and Rome, where a shared experience of both religion and literature was a defining element of the community, these two systems were particularly interdependent. In this course we will read a variety of texts (e.g. epic, philosophy, tragedy) and examine the complex ways that literary</span><span class="deschide"> concepts such as plot, character, closure and genre interact with religious concepts such as causation, moral justice, divine power, cosmology.

This course aims to explore the development of classical Greek rhetoric from the fifth century through the end of the fourth century BCE. In light of Plato’s and Aristotle’s analyses of the subject, we tend to view rhetoric as an art (technê) consisting of a set of methodically organized principles or norms for the production of persuasive speech. The use of rhetorical techniques, however, was widespread in the Greek speaking world well before Plato and Aristotle</span><span class="deschide"> began to reflect on its norms.

Egypt: No other region of the Graeco-Roman world provides us with as much information about the daily lives of its inhabitants, and no body of ancient evidence is more inclusive in its coverage. In this course, we will read selections from this corpus of evidence closely, focusing on documentary papyri, but also looking at literature, inscriptions, and other cultural objects (as well as some later comparative material). We will discuss what this material contributes</span><span class="deschide"> to our understanding of Graeco-Roman Egypt’s society and economy (law and status, gender, labor systems, education, religious practice, etc.), the limitations of the evidence, and its applicability to other regions of the ancient Mediterranean. All readings will be in English.</span><br/>

In this course, we will look at ancient Greek ideas and practices concerning the nature, sources, psychological effects, and social functions of music (including singing, instrumental music, and dance), during the Archaic and Classical periods (ca. 800-350 BCE). Taking an ethnomusicological approach, we will examine Greek musical culture as a whole, focusing especially on differences of gender, ethnicity, regionalism, class/status (e.g., free vs. slave), and even</span><span class="deschide"> species – since the Greeks recognized that some animals are very musical, as of course are several of the gods and goddesses – to see what different kinds of music were played by the various performers, and at what kinds of occasions.

This course will focus on ideas about magic in the Greek and Roman worlds from about 750 BCE through 400 CE. Topics will include witches, holy men, love spells, necromancy, spirits, and mystery religions.We will examine how magic was represented in high literature (by authors like Homer, Ovid, Apuleius and Lucian) as well as the more practical evidence of curse tablets and the Greek Magical Papyri. Consideration will be given to analyzing the relationship between magic</span><span class="deschide">, religion, and philosophy.

Slavery was one of the central institutions of life in classical Greece and Rome and had a profound affect on the ways these societies represented themselves and their world. In this course we will first spend some time learning about the historical condition of slavery in these two societies, then read a variety of works that show some of the ways that slaves and slavery operated in the intellectual and imaginative life of ancient authors. The three genres we will</span><span class="deschide"> focus on are philosophy, drama (both tragedy and comedy) and the novel.

Important individuals in Greek and Roman society were commemorated both in honorific portraits and in biographies written to record for posterity their lives and achievements. In this class we will be reading a selection of Greek and Latin biographical texts (in translation) and comparing them with statuary monuments that represent the same individuals.

What time is it? How old is the earth? Where are we located in history? For us these questions may have simple answers: we can look at a watch or a calendar or a timeline. But ancient people thought very differently about these questions. The aim of this class is to see how. We will look at a variety of ancient evidence, including literature (in translation) and archaeology, to discover how Greeks and Romans thought about the deep past (mythic time), how they understood</span><span class="deschide"> the direction and order of history, and how they organized and calculated time in their communities. We will also consider how ancient Jews and Christians came to reject classical conceptions of time and how this rejection still informs modern ideas about time and history.</span><br/>

Augustus, the first emperor of Rome, inaugurated an enormous building program during<br/>
his long reign that completely transformed the empire’s capital city. In this seminar we<br/>
will consider some of the most famous of his constructions—his Mausoleum (the tumulus<br/>
of the Julii), the temple of Palatine Apollo, the Ara Pacis Augustae (Altar of the<br/>
Augustan Peace), the Augustan Forum—and we will examine the ways in which these<br/>
new monuments helped shape</span><span class="deschide"> popular perceptions of the new system of government that<br/>
Augustus established (—a veiled monarchy).</span><br/>

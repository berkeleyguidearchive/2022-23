<h2>Overview</h2>




<p>Physics at UC Berkeley has long been at the forefront of discovery and achievement. In 1931, Ernest O. Lawrence invented the cyclotron at Berkeley, ushering in the era of high-energy physics and a tradition of achievement that continues today. Nine of Berkeley’s 22 Nobel Prizes were awarded to Berkeley physicists. The most recent National Research Council nationwide rankings identify the department as one of the best in the nation.</p>




<p>In the last 50 years, Berkeley physicists have made many of the significant discoveries that support today’s science. These discoveries extend from fundamental properties of elementary particles to spin echoes—the basis of magnetic resonance imaging to cutting-edge breakthroughs for building an accurate model of how the universe took shape following the monster explosion commonly known as the Big Bang. Today, faculty members are leading the way in scientific research and discovery in ways that may challenge the fundamental laws of physics particularly in the areas of gravitation, matter, and energy. At the same time, undergraduate and graduate teaching—through formal courses and research activity — is an integral part of the faculty’s commitment to the development of tomorrow’s scientists.</p>




<p>In their pursuit of original research, physics faculty members collaborate with postdoctoral fellows, Ph.D. graduate students, undergraduate students, and visiting scholars. Research opportunities include a wide range of topics in theoretical and experimental physics, astrophysics, atomic physics, molecular physics, biophysics, condensed matter, cosmic rays, elementary particles and fields, energy and resources, fusion and plasma, geochronology, general relativity, low-temperature physics, mathematical physics, nuclear physics, optical and laser spectroscopy, space physics, and statistical mechanics.</p>

Math is the natural language of physics. Of central importance to nearly all areas of physics are the fields of linear algebra and differential equations. A solid understanding of the structure and techniques of these fields will allow you to dig deeper into all of your physics courses and give you a greater appreciation of the beauty of physical theory. In this course we will develop and explore</span><span class="deschide"> a collection of tools including complex numbers, linear algebra, differential equations, Fourier series and transform methods, and tensors. Along the way this course will explore many example systems you were exposed to in your introductory physics classes including waves, circuits, rotations, and oscillations.</span><br/>

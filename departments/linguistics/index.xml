<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Housing the first linguistics department established in North America in 1901, UC Berkeley has a rich and distinguished tradition of rigorous linguistic documentation and theoretical innovation, thus making it an exciting and fulfilling place to carry out linguistic research. The department's original mission, from the anthropologist Alfred Kroeber and the Sanskrit and Dravidian scholar Murray B. Emeneau, was the recording and describing of unwritten languages, especially American Indian languages spoken in California and elsewhere in the United States. The current Department of Linguistics continues this tradition, integrating careful, scholarly documentation with cutting-edge theoretical work in phonetics, phonology, and morphology; syntax, semantics, and pragmatics; psycholinguistics; sociolinguistics and anthropological linguistics; historical linguistics; typology; and cognitive linguistics.</p>
<p>Much of the research is potentially interdisciplinary and/or involves the careful documentation of individual languages, language families, and their histories. The department has always had a strong commitment to the study of American Indian languages, and it also has special strengths in African, Asian, and European languages. Many of the faculty and graduate students participate in the activities of the Institute of Cognitive and Brain Studies, where they interact with scholars from a number of other disciplines including Psychology, Anthropology, Philosophy, Computer Science, Education, etc.</p>
<h3>Facilities</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/phonlab/">PhonLab</a> is a research and teaching laboratory within the department. Research focuses on documenting and explaining sound patterns in language.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.linguistics.berkeley.edu/Survey/">Survey of California and Other Indian Languages</a> is a research center within the department supporting the documentation, study, and revitalization of the indigenous languages of California and the Americas. The center maintains a major archive of field notes and other documentary materials, accessible in 1311 Dwinelle Hall and cataloged in the <a href="http://cla.berkeley.edu/">California Language Archive</a> (CLA); some material is digitized and available online. The center also curates the collection of linguistic field recordings from the <a href="http://blc.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Language Center</a>, many of which can be listened to on the CLA website.</p>
<p>The department has its own noncirculating library containing thousands of books, decades of journal subscriptions, and copies of (nearly) every linguistics dissertation completed at UC Berkeley as well as many dissertations from other institutions.</p>
<h3>Undergraduate Programs</h3>

Introduction to linguistics, the study of language. The course includes sections on the study of speech sounds (phonetics),how those sounds are structured to form words (phonology), the structure of complex words (morphology),the structure of sentences (syntax),and the study of word meaning and how words combine to form propositions (semantics).We will also address common misperceptions about what language is and what it isn’t, including notions of</span><span class="deschide"> linguistic “correctness” and how different individuals use language (sociolinguistics),how languages are related to each other and change over time (historical linguistics), and how children learn languages (language acquisition).This course draws on data from languages all around the world.</span><br/>

Everyone gestures – even when they might not realize it. This course seeks to uncover what we can learn about cognition and culture through the lens of this integral aspect of our communicative and cognitive selves. We will consider the relationship between language and gesture including its role in language acquisition and in signed languages, and study how gestures help us</span><span class="deschide"> communicate and help us think. We will also look at cross-cultural differences in gesture, the role of gesture in child development, applications of gesture from education to politics, and unpack the possibility of the gestural origins of human language.</span><br/>

Literary texts provide unique material for linguists: good authors manage to use everyday grammatical forms in exceptional ways. In this course, students will read scholarly linguistic works on literary analysis, and also analyze literary texts using the tools they acquire. Linguistics readings will focus on narratology and cognitive linguistic approaches, including mental spaces theory, conceptual metaphor theory, and work on iconicity, viewpoint</span><span class="deschide">, and causal structure.</span><br/>

How do young children acquire the phonological and phonetic patterns of the language surrounding them? It is well-established that children exhibit pronunciation patterns that differ from those of adult speakers. We will examine a range of factors that might contribute to this: perceptual, articulatory, speech-planning, grammatical.

Even within a single language or dialect, speech can vary greatly. Variation occurs between groups, between individuals, and even within individuals in different contexts. The primary influence for such speech variation is social factors such as gender or class. While many differences can be found in word choice or sentence structure, most variability occurs in pronunciation. The study of social influences on pronunciation</span><span class="deschide"> is known as 'sociophonetics', an interface of the two subfield, sociolinguistics and phonetics. In this course we will explore the development of the field, the linguistic features which vary, the social factors influencing these differences, questions of how children acquire knowledge of sociophonetic variation, as well</span><br/>

This course approaches writing as a cognitive activity, an attempt to translate ideas into written form which readers will understand.

We will employ Frame Semantics and Cognitive Metaphor Theory in analyzing and creating</span><span class="deschide"> written texts.

Students will continue to be introduced to various foundational issues and results in formal semantics. This course will provide a thorough introduction to intensionality as a phenomenon of natural language, as well as the core techniques and results of intensional (possible-world) semantics and the semantics of tense. In particular, we will examine in depth the semantics of sentential complements, the de re / de dicto distinction, modal auxiliaries, and tense and aspect</span><span class="deschide"> morphemes. We will pay special attention to the ways that languages may vary with respect to these phenomena.

Construction grammar arose in cognitive linguistics from phenomena showing how thought structures language and how language also structures thought, and from grammatical phenomena that could not be accounted for by transformational grammars. Over the past three decades two major theoretical approaches have evolved: One based on embodied cognition results, conceptual metaphor, and the neural modeling of brain mechanisms necessary to account for thought and language;</span><span class="deschide"> and another theoretical approach that is disembodied, purely formal, and uses feature structures and head-driven grammars.

This course is an introduction to the study of the linguistic and social phenomena that arise when speakers of different languages come in contact with one another, or when a community of speakers makes use of multiple languages.

<h2>Overview</h2>




<p>The Department of German offers language and literature classes in German, Dutch, and Yiddish, as well as breadth requirement courses (taught in English) on German philosophy, linguistics, political culture, and cinema. The department's degree options include an undergraduate major, a minor, and a PhD. Our renowned doctoral program is affiliated with the departments of Comparative Literature and Film and Media, the Program in Medieval Studies, and the Graduate Group in Critical Theory.</p>




<p>Both the size and diversity of our program allow us to balance thorough coverage of the basics with innovative thinking aimed at crossing borders. We have the critical mass to let our students explore interests outside the department and study with established experts. In these courses, our graduate students interact with students from across campus by all accounts a most beneficial experience. For the last half century, the Berkeley German department has consistently been recognized as one of the premier programs in the United States.</p>

The interdisciplinary curriculum provides a clear picture of these two constrasting monarchies. The historical, cultural, and linguistic relationship is a constant focus of the course. The literature (documentary</span><span class="deschide"> and fiction) concentrates on the Holcaust in the Low Countries. Students will engage with their subject matter not only in daily lectures, but also as eyewitnesses through regular field trips to museums and historical sites in Amsterdam, The Hague, Haarlem, Delft, Antwerp, Bruges, Ghent, Brussels, and other cities. Visits to the Royal Palace in Amsterdam, the House of Representatives, an interactive criminal trial, attendance at the International Court of Arbitration in The Hague, and the European Parliament in Brussels are included in the course.</span><br/>

How do we know what the “moral” of a story is? We will focus on three biblical narratives that have frequently been interpreted as teaching moral lessons: the story of Job, the story of Abraham and the binding of Isaac, and the story of Moses giving the law. These stories have been interpreted variously in moral terms--e.g. as demonstrating the virtues of faith, obedience, mercy, and forgiveness, and as teaching us about guilt, punishment, reward, and</span><span class="deschide"> human frailty. They have also been analyzed as existential parables, psychological dramas, and political allegories. The goal of this class is to examine how a range of different, and often provocative, interpretations of these stories’ moral lessons rest on particular ways of reading.</span><br/>

“Meditate that this came about: I command these words to you,” writes the Holocaust survivor and author Primo Levi. Taking seriously Levi’s dictum, this comparative course explores the ways in which the Holocaust has been represented in different media, including literature, film, and televisual narratives. To explore the political, aesthetic, and ethical dimensions of remembering the Nazi genocide, the course engages with a wide range of both documentary and fictional</span><span class="deschide"> genres, such as diaries, memoirs, lyric poetry, novels, home videos and feature films. Emphasis will be both on formal features and medial possibilities of representing the Shoah and their historical evolution since the end of World War II.</span><br/>

The history of Germany's first parliamentary democracy is a dramatic one, dominated by economic woes, political violence, and a general perception of crisis and decline. The ill-fated republic bore the burden of a devastating war and suffered from an increasing lack of popular support. Democratic procedures were constantly undermined by radical and reactionary forces. Cultural pessimism was nurtured by the overwhelming experience of historical</span><span class="deschide"> contingency, i.e., a fundamental lack of confidence in the predictability of modern life.</span><br/>

This course surveys the history, theory and practice of the genre called documentary cinema in a transnational horizon. We will explore what this amorphous and vague term means and examine the ways its forms and ethics have changed from the beginning of cinema to recent digital production and online exhibition. Major modes of documentary filmmaking will be covered, including cinema verité, direct cinema, investigative documentary, ethnographic</span><span class="deschide"> and travel film, agit-prop and activist media, autobiography and the personal essay as well as recent post-modern forms that question relationships between fact and fiction such as docudrama, archival film, and &quot;mockumentary.&quot;</span><br/>

This course will explore how experiences of migration, dislocation, or exile are visualized in cinema, and how processes of internationalization in film production and distribution intersect with the projection of a transnational global imagery. Some examples of transnational cinematic connections will be analyzed in historical perspective as well as contemporary examples of &quot;migrant cinema.&quot; We will investigate how these films engage</span><span class="deschide"> with debates about multiculturalism and assimilation/segregation of minorities, as scenarios of itinerancy and mobility are often intertwined with representations of ethnicity and gender.</span><br/>

This course will trace the development of Yiddish civilization down to today from the first settlement of Jews in German lands, roughly a thousand years ago. At its peak, Yiddish was spoken over a larger European territory than any language except Russian. In fact, long before Yiddish culture came to be centered in Eastern Europe, many of the best works of Old Yiddish literature were written in Renaissance Italy. Because Jews were a highly mobile population in</span><span class="deschide"> contact with many different peoples, Yiddish was everywhere influenced by neighboring languages and became the prototypical fusion language.</span><br/>

This course will trace the literary journey of Isaac Bashevis Singer (1904-1993)—the only Yiddish writer to win the Nobel Prize in Literature—from the small Polish village where he was born to the Upper West Side of Manhattan. For his American readers Singer represented a bridge between the Old World and the New, between religious tradition and American modernity. He seemed like a kindly old grandfather, telling jokes and feeding the pigeons on Broadway. But Singer</span><span class="deschide"> was a controversial figure in the Yiddish literary world: critics considered him a sellout for winning commercial success with stories about sex, immorality, and the supernatural.</span><br/>

This course will trace the history of Yiddish cinema from its &quot;golden era&quot; before World War II down to today. Jews famously played a big role in the development of modern cinema, especially as Hollywood<br/>
producers and studio moguls. But although many of these moguls knew Yiddish and were themselves immigrants, they were not anxious to make Jewish films at a time of increasing anti-Semitism. During Hollywood's Golden Age, Yiddish films were not made</span><span class="deschide"> by the major studios, but independently, mainly in New Many York and Poland. The Yiddish film industry was closely linked to the world of Yiddish theater, which was enormously popular on New York's Lower East Side.</span><br/>

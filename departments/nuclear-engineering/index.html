<h2>Overview</h2>




<p>The Department of Nuclear Engineering was established in 1958. There are currently about 78 graduate students in the department. Graduates find opportunities for employment and professional careers in the United States and abroad. Recent graduates are employed in academia, industry, national laboratories, and state and federal agencies.</p>




<p>The Nuclear Engineering program is comprised of classroom and laboratory instruction at the undergraduate and graduate levels and has a strong, diverse research program. The projects are part of the department's ongoing mission to provide an education to individuals who will make key contributions and become future leaders serving California and the nation by improving and applying nuclear science and technology.  The department's research areas include applied nuclear physics; bionuclear and radiological physics; computational methods; energy systems and the environment; ethics and the impact of technology on society; fission reactor design; fuel cycles and radioactive waste; plasma fusion science and technology; laser, particle beam, and plasma technologies; nuclear materials and chemistry; nuclear thermal hydraulics;  risk, safety, and large-scale systems analysis, and nonproliferation.</p>




<p>The department has strong relations with the nearby <a href="http://lbl.gov/">Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>, <a href="http://www.llnl.gov/">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a>, and <a href="http://www.lanl.gov/">Los Alamos National Laboratory</a>. A number of faculty and students collaborate with researchers in these laboratories, and use the facilities of these laboratories in their research projects.</p>




<a name="otherresources"></a>
<h3>Other Resources</h3>




<p>The department hosts a Monday colloquium series during the academic year. For further information and the schedule, please see the <a href="https://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/colloquiums">department's website</a>.</p>




<p>The department sponsors the <a href="http://radwatch.berkeley.edu/">Rad Watch project</a>. It has been performing a large range of radiation measurements starting in March 2011, following the releases of radioactive materials from the Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Japan. One of the goals of this activity was to measure the radioactivity in Californian samples that could potentially be associated with the releases in Japan using state-of-the-art experiments, to publish the data without filter or restriction, and to put the results in the context of the radiation we are exposed to in our daily lives. In response to the resurgent interest in radiation levels due to the expected arrival of cesium at the North American west coast, we are increasing our efforts again to measure samples potentially affected by the Pacific Ocean current transport. In addition to measurement samples of fish, seaweed, crab, etc., we are part of the <a href="http://kelpwatch.berkeley.edu/">Kelp Watch 2015 initiative</a>, which aims at measuring a potential cesium uptake into kelp over the next year.</p>

The goal is for graduate engineering students to gain sufficient understanding in how nuclear-power utilization affects the environment, so that they</span><span class="deschide"> are better prepared to design an advanced system that would result in minimized environmental impact. The lectures will consist of two parts. The first half includes mathematical models for individual processes in a fuel cycle, such as nuclear fuel reprocessing, waste solidification, repository performance, and nuclear transmutation in a nuclear reactor. In the second half, these individual models are integrated, which enables students to evaluate environmental impact of a fuel cycle.</span><br/>

Biomedical imaging is a clinically important application of engineering, applied mathematics, physics, and medicine. In this course, we apply linear systems theory and basic physics to analyze X-ray imaging, computerized tomography, nuclear medicine, and MRI. We cover the basic physics and instrumentation that characterizes medical image as an ideal perfect-resolution image blurred by an impulse response. This material could prepare the student</span><span class="deschide"> for a career in designing new medical imaging systems that reliably detect small tumors or infarcts.</span><br/>

Molecular biology describing the cellular response and the DNA repair mechanisms will be covered, with an emphasis on cell kinetics such as recovery processes and cell cycle sensitivity. The overall tissue response will also be discussed with an effort to distinguish acute and delayed effects. Radiation risk models and their impact on limits will be introduced and described in the context of past and current research.<br/>This course is designed for Nuclear Engineering students and in particular those pursuing a Medical Physics Certificate with knowledge essential to radiobiology.

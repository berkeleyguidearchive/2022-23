<h2>Overview</h2>




<p>The mission of the Department of City and Regional Planning is to improve equity, the economy and the environment in neighborhoods, communities, cities, and metropolitan regions by creating knowledge and engagement through our teaching, research, and service. We aim to design and create cities, infrastructure, and public services that are sustainable, affordable, enjoyable, and accessible to all.</p>




<p>Wisely and successfully intervening in the public realm, whether locally, nationally, or globally, is a challenge. Our urban future is complex and rapidly changing. Resource scarcity and conflict, technological innovation, retrofitting of existing built environments, and social empowerment will alter the ways in which planning has conventionally been carried out. We believe the planning academy has a special responsibility to always address social justice, equity, and ethics; to teach and research means of public participation, collective decision making, and advocacy; and to focus on reforming institutions, urban governance, policy, and planning practices to make these goals possible.</p>




<p>Our undergraduate and graduate programs, as well as faculty research and community service activities, address social justice, equity, and ethics; innovative means of public participation, collective decision making, and advocacy; and ways to reform institutions, urban governance, policy, and planning practices. Faculty research harnesses the latest methods and data, ranging from ethnography to sophisticated 3-D simulations and visualization. Faculty expertise is diverse and includes sustainable transportation and land use, economic development, urban health and social policy, environmental assessment and sustainability, global urbanization and poverty, and urban design for livable places.</p>

Over half of the world's population is now urban. As urban populations swell, metropolitan areas in both the developed and the developing world struggle to provide basic services and address the negative externalities associated with rapid growth. Sanitation, transportation, pollution, energy services, and public safety typically fall to sub-national governments. Yet local sub-national institutions face difficulties as they tackle these challenges because</span><span class="deschide"> development tends to spill over political boundaries and resources are limited. Such difficulties are particularly acute in the developing world due to tighter resource constraints, weak institutions, and the comparative severity of the underlying problems. Moreover, democratization and decentralization suggest that urban governance and service delivery may have become more democratic, but present challenges with respect to priority setting, coordination, and corruption.</span><br/>

Community development, broadly defined as efforts to improve the quality of life in low-income communities, has existed in multiple forms for centuries.

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> The course introduces students to key paradigms of planning thought. The course is organized around the principle that histories of city planning are also about theories of planning. <br/>In addition to writing instruction, the course provides an opportunity for further professional development through students conducting interviews for their core paper assignment and drafting a resume and professional development plan outlining their academic and career goals. Students also will be exposed to practitioners in planning and related fields through guest speakers in class during the second half of the course on contemporary topics.<br/>The course Introduces students to city and regional planning ideas, history and practices and how they have shaped and responded to urban development. As histories of city planning are rooted in the quest for spatial order, the course seeks to enable students to have a deeper understanding of how space functions in tandem with history, practice and policy implementation.<br/>The course will provide instruction on writing – professional quality deliverables for master’s students and scholarly level text and orientation for doctoral students.<br/>We will discuss the power and limits of planning, planning and social change, the multiple roles in which planners find themselves, and the relationship between planning and built and natural environments. We will consider views of key stakeholders and members of the public from across the political spectrum. We will examine current pressing planning and policy issues in the context of their historical underpinnings.</p></div>

This course focuses on the deeply contested and political nature of land-use. It uses the spatial lens to situate land-use planning within wider processes of globalization. A central premise is to link land-use planning to property rights, and to ask: how is land, a spatially fixed resource with unique characteristics in each location, transformed into an asset for private ownership, an instrument of finance, a fungible asset; and what are</span><span class="deschide"> the distributive conflicts that arise from private property? The course is also committed to an exploration of how planners can move towards more emancipatory land-use practices.</span><br/>

This course traces the main ways in which these debates have unfolded since the middle of the nineteenth century to the present. To follow these debates is to understand how scholars have struggled to make cities legible, to fix them as objects of analysis, and</span><span class="deschide"> simultaneously to capture their processes of transformation.</span><br/>

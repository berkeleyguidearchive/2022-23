<p><strong>The Center for Interdisciplinary Bio-inspiration in Education and Research (CIBER)</strong> has been established to lead in the development of a new field of Integrative Systems Biomechanics that moves biology toward greater integration with other disciplines such as physics, mathematics, and engineering to a degree not seen before. The discipline focuses on the physics of how organisms function and interact with their environment. The goal is to discover basic physical principles that can be applied to a diversity of organisms and unique innovations. The fluid and solid mechanics of organisms are examined using direct experimentation, comparative and phylogenetic approaches, and both mathematical and physical modeling. Using this approach, the next generation of scientists and engineers will gain experience in collaboration across disciplines, as well as how to extract principles in biology that inspire novel design in engineering. In addition to developing innovative methods of teaching and research, CIBER has established an interdisciplinary teaching laboratory that allows students in undergraduate as well as graduate courses to address challenging problems that will give them a meaningful interdisciplinary learning experience. These facilities are being used in a number of existing and new courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. For more information on CIBER, visit their <a href="http://ciber.berkeley.edu">website.</a></p>

Mechanisms by which key physiological priorities are maintained in healthy humans. From a basis in elementary theories of information and control, we develop an understanding of homeostasis of cellular composition, structure, and energy metabolism.

The primary goal of this course is to provide students with a broad understanding of the evolution of hormonal systems. A comparative approach allows us to envisage how the complex mammalian endocrine system presumably evolved from that of more primitive vertebrates. Students will learn about endocrine pathways and endocrine-based behaviors of jawless fishes, fishes, amphibia, reptiles, birds, and mammals. In addition, students will gain</span><span class="deschide"> an understanding of the experimental methods used in endocrine research. The class teaches students how to read and interpret the primary scientific literature; thus it encourages the critical thinking that is a fundamental skill for any scientist.</span><br/>

How do experiences and exposures get “under the skin” to impact human development? This course takes a research approach to understanding environmental origins of adult behavior. We begin with foundations in endocrinology, neurobiology, reproduction, and development. This sets the stage for studying how experiences influence development, including nutrition, stress, immune challenges, endocrine disruptors, and more. Students will engage in authentic research using seasonal</span><span class="deschide"> transitions in rodent physiology and behavior to understand adaptation to changing environments.</span><br/>

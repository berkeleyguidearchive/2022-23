<h2>Religious Creed Policy</h2>
<p>The Berkeley campus's policy for accommodation of students who miss exams because of their religious commitment is distributed annually at the beginning of each fall semester. The most recent statement is dated August 18, 2010. The policy follows:</p>
<h3>Accommodation of religious creed</h3>
<p>In compliance with Education code, Section 92640(a), it is the official policy of the University of California at Berkeley to permit any student to undergo a test or examination, without penalty, at a time when that activity would not violate the student's religious creed, unless administering the examination at an alternate time would impose an undue hardship which could not reasonably have been avoided. Requests to accommodate a student's religious creed by scheduling tests or examinations at alternative times should be submitted directly to the faculty member responsible for administering the examination.Â <span>Reasonable common sense, judgment and the pursuit of mutual goodwill should result in the positive resolution of scheduling conflicts. The regular campus appeals process applies if a mutually satisfactory arrangement cannot be achieved.</span></p>

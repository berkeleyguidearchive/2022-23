				<a name="semestersystemunitsrepetitionofcoursestext"></a><h2>Semester System, Units, &amp; Repetition of Courses</h2><div>
<h3>The Semester System</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Under the semester system on the UC Berkeley campus, the academic year is divided into two semesters and one summer session. Quarter units, either earned previously at Berkeley or at another institution, are converted to semester units by multiplying by two-thirds (for example, 180 quarter units equal 120 semester units).</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Courses and Units</h3>
<p>Most University courses are assigned a unit value. One unit represents three hours of work per week by the student, including class attendance, preparation, and outside work.</p>
<h4>Course Number Guide</h4>
 <p>For an explanation of the prefixes, suffixes, and course numbering system used in UC Berkeley's <a href="/2022-23/courses" target="_blank">course listings</a>, please see the guide provided below.</p> <h3>Prefixes to Course Numbers</h3> <p><strong>C =</strong> Course is cross-listed with another department<br/> <strong>H =</strong> Honors course<br/> <strong>N =</strong> Summer-only course not equivalent to a regular session course with the same number<br/> <strong>R =</strong> Satisfies Reading and Composition (R &amp; C) requirement<br/> <strong>W =</strong> Offered fully or predominantly online (prefix no longer required for online courses)</p> <hr/> <h3>Suffixes to Course Numbers</h3> <p><strong>AC =</strong> Satisfies American Cultures requirement</p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-272b5241-7fff-fb24-8009-399a578519c2">Students should check with their major or minor advising unit to verify which courses will satisfy curriculum requirements.</span></p> <hr/> <h3>Key to Course Numbers</h3> <p><strong>1-99 =</strong> Lower division (undergraduate) courses<br/> <strong>100-199 =</strong> Upper division (undergraduate) courses<br/> <strong>200-299 = </strong>Graduate courses<br/> <strong>300-399 =</strong> Professional courses for teachers and prospective teachers<br/> <strong>400-499 =</strong> Other professional courses (acceptable toward academic degrees only within limitations prescribed by a college, school, or the Graduate Division)<br/> <strong>601 =</strong> Special study for graduate students in preparation for master's examination<br/> <strong>602 =</strong> Special study for graduate students in preparation for doctoral qualifying examination</p> <hr/> <h5><strong>Courses Numbered 24, 39, &amp; 84</strong></h5> <p>Freshman and Sophomore Seminars<br/> For further information, please see the <a href="http://fss.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Freshman and Sophomore Seminars at Berkeley website</a>.</p> <h5><strong>Courses Numbered 97</strong></h5> <p>Field Studies (lower division)<br/> You may use no more than 16 semester units of courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, 198, and 199 to meet requirements for the bachelor's degree. <span id="docs-internal-guid-d7e644cf-7fff-1b43-631c-e4648de38152">You may aggregate no more than 4 units of credit for courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, 198, and 199 for a single semester</span>.

Units earned in these courses may not be used to meet academic residence of unit requirements towards a degree.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Repetition of Courses</h3>
<p>You may repeat only courses in which you received a grade of D+, D, D-, F, NP, or U. You may repeat an I grade subject to certain limitations (see Grade I). Courses in which you received a grade of D+, D, D-, or F, and courses that you undertook for a letter grade but for which you received a grade of I, may not be repeated on a passed/not passed or satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis. Repetition of a course more than once requires approval by the dean of the college, school, or division in which you are enrolled at the time you repeat the course. Without this approval, a course repeated more than once will not be included in the grade point average (GPA), but a passing grade in the repeated course will be accepted in satisfaction of unit requirements for the degree. Degree credit for a repeated course will be given only once, but the grade assigned at each enrollment is permanently recorded. If you repeat courses in which you received a grade of D+, D, D-, or F, the units are counted only once and only the most recently earned grades and grade points are used for the first 12 units repeated. Second repetitions that are approved by the dean of a student's college or school are to be included in the 12-unit limitation. In case of repetitions beyond the 12 units, the GPA is based on all grades assigned and total units attempted. If, however, you receive a grade of I upon repetition of a course, the grade of D+, D, D-, or F will continue to be computed in the GPA until the I grade is replaced. <span id="docs-internal-guid-69304604-7fff-dfca-350f-666b9eb5ea34"> If you repeat an I in a letter-graded course, the I will lapse to an F unless you have permission from the dean of your college or school to retain the I grade for a longer period.</span></p>
</div>
			</div>
			<div id="gradestextcontainer" class="page_content tab_content" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="gradestexttab" >
				<a name="gradestext"></a><h2>Grades</h2><p><span>The work of all students on the UC Berkeley campus is reported in terms of the following grades: A (excellent); B (good); C (fair); D (barely passed); F (failure); P (passed at a minimum level of C- for undergraduate students); NP (not passed); S (satisfactory, passed at a minimum level of B- for graduate students); U (unsatisfactory); I (work incomplete due to circumstances beyond the student’s control, but of passing quality); and IP (work in progress, final grade to be assigned upon completion of entire course sequence). The grades A, B, C, and D may be modified by plus (+) or minus (-) suffixes.</span></p>
<p>A course in which the grade A, B, C, D, or P (undergraduate students only) is counted toward degree requirements, as outlined in the regulations of a student's college or major. A course receiving the grade S (graduate students only) is similarly counted subject to Academic Senate regulations. A course in which the grade F, NP, or U is received is not counted toward degree requirements. A course in which the grade of I or IP is received is not counted toward degree requirements until the I or IP is replaced by grade A, B, C, D, P, or S.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Grade Points</h3>
<p>Grade points per unit are assigned as follows: A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, and F=none. When attached to the grades A, B, C, or D, plus (+) grades carry three-tenths of a grade point more per unit, and minus (-) grades three-tenths of a grade point less per unit than unsuffixed grades, except for A+, which carries 4.0 grade points per unit as does the A.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Grade Point Average (GPA)</h3>
<p>Your GPA is computed on courses undertaken in the University of California. Effective fall 2005, XB courses undertaken in UC Berkeley Extension count toward your GPA. Grades A, B, C, D, and F are used in determining your GPA; grades IP, P, S, NP, and U carry no grade points and are excluded from all grade-point computations. Grade I, if assigned before fall 1973, is included and is computed as an F; an I grade assigned fall 1973 and later is excluded from computations. For additional information, see the <a href="/2022-23/academic-policies/#semestersystemunitsrepetitionofcoursestext">Repetition of Courses</a> section<a href="/2022-23/academic-policies/" target="_blank">.</a></p>
<hr/>
<h3>Special Provisions: Graduate Students</h3>
<p>Only courses graded A, B, C (with or without plus or minus signs), or S are accepted in satisfaction of degree requirements. Courses graded below C- do not yield unit credit toward a higher degree, regardless of your overall GPA. Graduate students must maintain a minimum GPA of 3.0 in all upper division and graduate coursework undertaken in graduate standing in the University of California or its exchange programs.</p>
<p><em>Note: </em>Departments, schools, and groups may have a higher performance standard than the minimum B average (3.0 GPA) required by the Graduate Division. You must also work full time at your academic or professional program unless a program with fewer units is approved under special circumstances by your graduate adviser. In addition, you must successfully complete all coursework required by your department, school, or group program, be advanced to candidacy, pass the required examinations, and fulfill other requirements specified for the program.</p>
<p>For a course extending over more than one semester in which evaluation of your performance is deferred until the end of the final semester, provisional grades of In Progress (IP) may be assigned in the intervening semesters. The provisional grades are replaced by the final grade if you complete the full sequence. If you do not complete the full sequence, then you will be given an I grade if the instructor has no other basis for assigning a grade. Further changes will be made according to Academic Senate regulations.</p>
<p>With the consent of the department involved, graduate students may enroll in courses in the 600-series. These courses are evaluated by means of the grades satisfactory and unsatisfactory (S and U). They prepare you for appropriate master’s or doctoral examinations and do not count toward academic residence or the unit requirements for a higher degree. You may earn 1-8 units of 601 or 602 per semester or 1-4 units per summer session toward examination preparation. Units earned in these courses may not be used to meet academic residence or unit requirements for the Master or Doctor's degree. No credit is allowed for work graded unsatisfactory.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Passed/Not Passed and Satisfactory/ Unsatisfactory Grades</h3>
<p>If you are an undergraduate in good academic standing (2.0 GPA or better, or in good academic standing under the academic probation regulations of your college or school), you may elect to take letter-graded courses on a passed/not passed basis, and if you are a graduate student in good academic standing, you may elect to take letter-graded courses on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis with the consent of your department, school, or group. Credit for courses taken on these bases is limited to one-third of the total units that you have taken and passed on the Berkeley campus at the time your degree is awarded. Included in this one-third are any units completed in an Education Abroad program, or on another University of California campus in an intercampus exchange program, or in a joint doctoral program. For graduate degree programs, grades of satisfactory assigned in courses numbered 299 and of the 300, 400, or 600 series are excluded from this computation. If you enroll in a course offered only on a passed/not passed or satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis, you will be graded P/NP if an undergraduate and S/U if a graduate.</p>
<p>A course that is required in or prerequisite to your major may be taken on a P/NP or S/U basis only upon approval of the faculty of your school or college.</p>
<p>If you are a special or limited-status student, you may take courses on a P/NP basis at the discretion of the dean of your college or school. You may not repeat a course on a P/NP basis that you have previously taken on a letter-graded basis.</p>
<p>The option of being graded P/NP or S/U in a course may be cancelled if you are found to be ineligible for the option.</p>
<p>If you want honors at graduation, you should consult your college, school, or division for additional restrictions.</p>
<p>Your level of performance must correspond to a minimum letter grade of C- if you are to receive a passed grade, and to a B- if you are to receive a satisfactory grade.</p>
<p>These rules may be further limited by the faculties of the various schools and colleges and by the Graduate Council.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Grade I (Incomplete)</h3>
<p>The grade I may be assigned if your work in a course has been of passing quality, but is incomplete for reasons beyond your control. Prior arrangements must be made with the instructor because in assigning the I grade the instructor is required to specify the reasons to the department chair.</p>
<p>For graduate students, the I grade will remain on the record until the required work is completed. Graduate students should finish the course requirements as soon as possible. The instructor will file a change of grade for Incompletes through CalCentral and Campus Solutions. The method of replacement of the I grade by a final grade will be determined by the Dean of the Graduate Division and the Graduate Council. </p>
<p>Although I grades are not counted in computing the GPA, it is important to remove them quickly. You should seek the advice of the Graduate Division if you have further questions concerning I grades.</p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-8970d779-7fff-275e-a28c-75b0b3205b5e">For undergraduate students, the I grade has completion and replacement deadlines. Students must complete the required course work at least 30 days prior to the deadline for replacing the I grade.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left:40px"><span id="docs-internal-guid-8970d779-7fff-275e-a28c-75b0b3205b5e">Fall Semester: An I grade received in the fall semester must be completed 30 days prior to the first day of instruction of the following fall semester or by the instructor-provided deadline, whichever is earlier. The I grade will be replaced by the first day of the following fall semester.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left:40px"><span id="docs-internal-guid-8970d779-7fff-275e-a28c-75b0b3205b5e">Spring Semester and Summer Sessions - An I grade received in the spring semester or summer session must be completed 30 days prior to the first day of instruction of the following spring semester or by the instructor-provided deadline, whichever is earlier. The I grade will be replaced by the first day of the following spring semester.</span></p>
<p>When you complete the required work or deferred examination, grade points will be assigned if you receive a grade of A, B, C, or D. If you repeat the course, grade points will then be assigned to the earned grade only if the dean has given prior written approval to repeat it. If you repeat the course without the approval of the dean, the I grade will be converted to an F and the repeated course will be treated the same as any other course in which you receive an F. The dean of your college or school may extend the deadline for undergraduate completion of an I grade. For undergraduates, except as noted below, any I grade which has not been replaced within the above deadlines will, at the end of that time, be converted to grade F (or NP if taken passed/not passed). After that time, but not retroactively, the grade is counted in computing your GPA.</p>
<p><strong>Exceptions:</strong> Within the above deadlines for completing an I grade, undergraduate students may notify the dean that they have not attempted completion and will not complete the work required for removal of the I grade, and may request that the grade not be replaced by an F (or NP). This procedure is limited to a maximum of two courses. Once the decision has been made, it is irrevocable; the course cannot afterward be completed by any means, including repetition of that course or any equivalent course.</p>
<p>If a degree is conferred before the end of the above deadlines following the assignment of an I grade, the grade will not be converted to an F (or NP). However, you still have the option of removing the I grade within the above deadlines.</p>
<p>If you are an undergraduate student with 12 or more units of I on your record, you may not register without the permission of the dean.</p>
<p>You should make arrangements to complete the course 30 days before the deadline. The instructor will file a change of grade <span id="docs-internal-guid-18b7afe2-7fff-2e7b-bb56-b7054806d730">for Incompletes through CalCentral and</span> Campus Solutions.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Grade IP (In Progress)</h3>
<p>If you take a course extending over more than one term and evaluation of your performance is deferred until the end of the final term, provisional grades of IP (In Progress) are assigned in the intervening term(s). The provisional grades are replaced by one final grade if you complete the full sequence. The IP grade is not included in the GPA. Effective with an IP assigned fall 1973 or later, if the full sequence is not completed as scheduled, the IP will be replaced by a grade of Incomplete. Further changes in your record will be subject to the rules pertaining to I grades above.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Changes of Grade</h3>
<p>All grades except I and IP above are considered final when assigned by an instructor at the end of a term. An instructor may request a change of grade when a computational, clerical, or procedural error occurred in the original assignment of a grade, but a grade may not be changed as a result of reevaluation of your work. No final grade may be revised as a result of reexamination or the submission of additional work after the close of the term.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Grade Appeal Process</h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-3a7cc1f4-7fff-a4de-dccc-41ca7d4f7afb">If you have a grievance about a grade, you should first try to speak with your instructor and/or the student </span><a href="http://sa.berkeley.edu/ombuds">ombuds</a>. If that does not resolve your grievance, you may initiate a formal appeal through the academic department where you received the grade. The following are grounds for appeal: the application of non-academic criteria, such as the consideration of race, politics, religion, sex, or other criteria not directly reflective of performance related to course requirements; sexual harassment; or improper academic procedures that unfairly affect your grade. Formal procedures may not be activated unless you (the student) and the instructor in charge have failed to resolve the dispute informally. You (the student) may opt to include an ombuds (or any mutually accepted third party) and/or the department chair in resolving the dispute informally. The formal process must be initiated within one calendar year from the last day of the semester in which the final grade for the course was posted. The formal process, once initiated, is to be completed at the unit level (academic department) within 20-working days and at the Senate level within 40-working days if both parties are in residence and the University is in regular session (excluding summer session).</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Formal Appeal of Grades in Courses </h3>
<p>Each department or other instructional unit shall establish a standing grievance committee chair who is not the chair of the department. For each case, the grievance committee chair will appoint an <em>ad hoc</em> grievance committee composed of three faculty members—only two of whom can be from the same unit—<span id="docs-internal-guid-d2df7a63-bcf9-7af0-0823-829c96ae66a9">and two students in good standing appointed by the student association of the unit</span>. If no student association exists, the students are to be appointed by the ASUC or the Graduate Assembly. (The student members must have passed courses or an examination in the unit at least at the level of the disputed course or examination and have been in residence for at least one year.) The instructor of record for the course in dispute cannot be a member of this committee. The ad hoc grievance committee will review all the required materials (from the student and instructor) and make a recommendation regarding a resolution to the grievance. The ad hoc grievance committee’s recommendation to the Committee on Courses of Instruction (COCI), including any minority views, must be given in writing.</p>
<p>If COCI finds in the student’s favor, it may change a failing grade to a P or S, drop a course retroactively, retain the course but eliminate the grade from the GPA, or adopt the letter grade, if any, that was recommended by four of the five members of the grievance committee of the unit(s).</p>
<p>For a complete copy of current grade grievance procedures, please see the <a href="http://academic-senate.berkeley.edu/committees/coci" target="_blank">COCI page on the Academic Senate's website</a>.

				<a name="creditbyexaminationtext"></a><h2>Credit by Examination</h2><h3><span>Undergraduate Students</span></h3>
<p>You may earn credit by examination in two ways:</p>
<ol>
	<li>If you are a new or re-entering undergraduate student, on the recommendation of the Board of Admissions you may be allowed credit by examination for knowledge that you acquired since graduation from high school, either by independent study or at another institution, and for which you have not been allowed advanced standing credit. You should apply to the <a href="http://registrar.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/CREDIT.EXAM.Pet.pdf" target="_blank">Office of the Registrar</a> for credit.</li>
	<li>If you are a student in good standing and currently registered in a regular session, you may qualify for course credit by examination. You may apply for credit to the dean of your college or school on the “Petition for Credit by Examination,” obtainable from the <a href="http://registrar.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/CREDIT.EXAM.Pet.pdf" target="_blank">Office of the Registrar</a>. You may apply for credit by examination in any course listed in the current bulletin that pertains to the regular sessions at UC Berkeley. However, the subject in which you want to be examined should be one in which, in the opinion of the instructor in charge or the department, knowledge can be tested by examination. You must file a separate petition for each course. In certain laboratory, field, or practice courses, neither a written nor an oral examination may be a satisfactory test.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may <u>not</u> receive credit by examination:</p>
<ol>
	<li>If the credit would duplicate credit that you presented for admission to the University.</li>
	<li>In elementary courses in your native language if it is not English.</li>
</ol>
<p>The examination must cover the entire course and be administered at one sitting of no longer than three hours. It may be the regularly scheduled final examination for the class, provided that the examination meets the foregoing criteria. The result of the examination may be reported to the Office of the Registrar only as passed or satisfactory, according to the regulations governing the assignment of these grades. Further information concerning credit by examination may be obtained from the <a href="http://registrar.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/CREDIT.EXAM.Pet.pdf" target="_blank">Office of the Registrar</a>.</p>
<h3>Graduate Students</h3>
<p>If you are a graduate student in residence, you may petition to receive a limited amount of course credit toward your degree by passing examinations on material covered in certain courses in lieu of taking those courses. Laboratory courses, graduate seminar, and research courses are excluded. You must be registered for at least 4 units of upper division and/or graduate coursework at the time you take the examination and you must be in good academic standing (3.0 GPA or better). The final result of the examination will only be reported as satisfactory or unsatisfactory. You may obtain the petition from the <a href="http://registrar.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/CREDIT.EXAM.Pet.pdf" target="_blank">Office of the Registrar</a>. Approval to take these examinations must be given by the dean of the Graduate Division and by the course instructor, or, if no instructor is designated, by the department chair.</p>

Deficient grades for undergraduate students whose work at midterm is of D+, D, D-, F, or NP quality are posted on CalCentral during the ninth week of the semester. </span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-33fe3d76-7fff-4309-2d08-8a3dd487e896">Final examinations are required in all undergraduate non-laboratory courses, with the exception of courses that the Committee on Courses of Instruction (COCI) has approved to offer an alternative form of final assessment or as exempt from a final examination. This requirement allows you to demonstrate mastery of course material while providing the instructor with written evidence for evaluation. The examination may last no longer than three hours and must be administered at the time announced in the </span><a href="https://registrar.berkeley.edu/scheduling/academic-scheduling/final-exam-guide-schedules">online Schedule of Classes</a>. Any deviation from this announced time requires approval from COCI or, in temporary changes, the department chair. This requirement guarantees you ample prior notice of the examination time and eliminates conflict with other examinations.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of instructors and/or departments to return to students their final examinations or copies of them, or to retain students’ final examin­ations or copies of them, for 13 months after the dates of such examinations.</p>

				<a name="degreeprogresstext"></a><h2>Degree Progress</h2><h3>Undergraduate Students: Progress Toward a Degree</h3>
<p><span>At the close of each semester, the courses, units, grades, and grade points earned are added onto your cumulative University record. From this record, you may determine your progress toward a degree.</span></p>
<p>In working for a degree, you should keep in mind the various levels on which you must satisfy requirements-- University, campus, college or school, and department-- as well as the kinds of requirements you must fulfill: course, unit, grade point, and amount of upper division work. You may receive additional counsel in these matters from your adviser.</p>
<h4>Minimum Progress</h4>
<p>For undergraduates, normal progress toward a degree requires 30 units of successfully completed coursework each year. If you fail to achieve minimum academic progress, you may continue to be enrolled only with the approval of the dean of your college or school. To achieve minimum academic progress, you must have successfully completed a number of units no fewer than 15 times the number of semesters, less one, in which you have been enrolled on the Berkeley campus. Summer session is not counted as a semester. A course load of 15 units per semester is considered normal. Minimum course load requirements, however, vary by college or school; see the specific college or school announcement for details. If you enroll in a course load of fewer units than the minimum, you will need to have your schedule approved by the dean of your college or school.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Undergraduate Students: Probation and Dismissal</h3>
<h4>Academic Probation</h4>
<p>Regulations and procedures governing academic probation vary with each college and school. For specific details, consult your college or school website. Students on probation may not take courses on a passed/not passed basis.</p>
<h4>Academic Dismissal</h4>
<p>Regulations and procedures governing academic dismissal vary with each college and school. For specific details, consult your college or school.</p>
<p>If you are dismissed, you may appeal for a hearing by formal petition to the dean of your college or school, but the action of dismissal is normally considered final. If you are dismissed and want to transfer to another college or school at Berkeley, you may petition the dean of that college or school.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Graduate Students: Probation and Dismissal</h3>
<p><span>Graduate students are subject to probation and dismissal for academic deficiencies by the Graduate Division under the policies established by the Graduate Council of the Academic Senate. Probation may be initiated by the Graduate Division or by recommendation of the head graduate adviser of your major. The most common reasons for probation are a low GPA and failure to make adequate and timely progress toward the degree. If your probationary status is not rectified within the specified time allowed, you may be subject to dismissal.  If a student has advanced to doctoral candidacy and fails to make adequate progress toward completing the dissertation, probation takes the form of “lapsing” the student’s candidacy. This probationary status must also be resolved and the student’s candidacy reinstated to avoid dismissal.</span></p>
<p>There are circumstances that allow you to appeal dismissal from graduate standing. The “Graduate Appeal Procedure” is available on the <a href="http://www.grad.berkeley.edu/policies/pdf/gradappeal.pdf" target="_blank">Graduate Division website</a>. The procedure may not be used for complaints regarding actions based solely on faculty evaluation of the academic quality of a student’s performance, or decanal evaluations of a student’s appropriate academic progress, unless the complaint alleges that those actions were unduly biased by non-academic criteria.</p>

<h3>Graduate Student Appeals</h3>
<p>Through the Graduate Appeal Procedure, graduate students have the right to appeal academic or administrative decisions that have materially hindered their degree progress or resulted in dismissal from their graduate program.</p>
<p>Students must first initiate an appeal with the academic unit (the department, school, or graduate group) responsible for the alleged action under dispute. The Graduate Council requires each instructional unit to maintain copies of its current internal appeal procedure for information and use by its graduate students.</p>
<p>The academic unit and the student must make all reasonable efforts at resolving the difficulty, as outlined in the Graduate Appeal Procedure, before the student may take the matter to the next level, which is the Graduate Division. Students may also consult with the <a href="http://sa.berkeley.edu/ombuds" target="_blank">Ombuds for Students</a> at 510-642-5754 for assistance with informal resolution.</p>
<p>If attempts to resolve the matter with the student's home unit were unsuccessful, the student may submit a formal appeal to the Graduate Division, after carefully following the guidelines and deadlines in the <a href="http://www.grad.berkeley.edu/policies/pdf/gradappeal.pdf" target="_blank">Graduate Appeal Procedure</a>. The <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/policies/pdf/appealform.pdf" target="_blank">Graduate Appeal Procedure Form</a> must accompany the appeal.</p>

<h3>Classroom Note-Taking and Recording Policy</h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7f4505c1-22b4-2246-9fb6-3194aea4bbc4">The University encourages students to take notes in class and other instructional settings as part of their education. Note-taking is a means of recording information and helps students absorb and integrate what they learn. Note-taking or other recordings of an instructor’s presentation can also facilitate further discussion of the material with students and the instructor. However, class notes and recordings are based on the intellectual effort of the instructor, who has an interest in protecting this effort and ensuring the accuracy of any public representation of his or her work. Prior approval of the instructor is required for the recording of course notes and the sharing of course notes and other class materials beyond the students enrolled in the course. Only a course note-taking service authorized by the campus may make course notes available commercially. </span><span>Here are the</span><a href="http://dsp.berkeley.edu/students/returning-students/services/note-taking/dsp-process-class-notes"> relevant policies</a> for note-taking services.</p>

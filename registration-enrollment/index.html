<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-ff0a734d-7fff-33fa-7be6-4b39eab72f33">If you do not wish to attend the University for a semester and instruction has not yet begun, you must submit a withdrawal form via CalCentral &gt; My Dashboard &gt; Student Resources &gt; Add a Withdrawal Request. Tuition and fees will be removed from your account if completed before instruction begins. If instruction has already begun and you find it necessary to stop attending classes, you must submit the Withdrawal form via CalCentral &gt; My Dashboard &gt; Student Resources &gt; Add a Withdrawal Request. Tuition and Fees will be pro-rated depending on the withdrawal date.

<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-998dfb17-7fff-e840-a3ba-038ab068f2b8">A resident is a person who has been determined to have satisfied all University of California (UC) residency requirements to be classified as a California resident for tuition purposes. A non-resident is a person who has been determined to not meet all UC residency requirements and is assessed non-resident supplemental tuition (NRST) in addition to the mandatory resident fees. For more in-depth information on UC Residency requirements, you can also either visit the </span><a href="http://registrar.berkeley.edu/tuition-fees-residency/residency-tuition-purposes">Office of the Registrar website</a> or review the <a href="https://www.ucop.edu/uc-legal/_files/ed-affairs/uc-residence-policy.pdf">UC policy here</a>.</p>

<h3 class="hed3">Law Governing Residence</h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-4a0faf55-7fff-52fe-a7f3-b5e602252de2">The rules regarding legal residence for tuition and fee purposes at the University of California are governed by the California Education Code as adopted by Standing Order 110.2 and Regents Policy 3105 of The Regents of the University of California. Under these rules, adult citizens, permanent resident card holders, or certain classes of immigrants and non-immigrants can establish residency for tuition and fee purposes. There are also particular rules that apply to the residency classification of minors (under the age of 18 years).</span></p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="hed3">Who Is a California Resident?</h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-4905e169-7fff-6ca7-4bda-d411cec85d47">If you are an adult — 24 years and older — or a graduate student and want to be classified as a resident for tuition and fee purposes, you must be in an eligible immigration status for at least 366 days prior to the residence determination date for the term for which you seek a resident classification. The residence determination date is the day instruction begins at UC Berkeley. Eligible immigration statuses include U.S. citizen, permanent resident, and certain non-immigrant visas. However, some non-immigrant visas may preclude you from establishing residency (i.e. B, F, J, TD/TN). You must also have established your continuous physical presence in California for at least 366 days prior to the residence determination date for the semester during which you are seeking a resident classification, and relinquished ties to any previous residence. Additionally, you must present legal evidence that you intend to make California your permanent home. Physical presence within the state solely for educational purposes does not constitute the establishment of California residency under state law, regardless of the length of your stay. Your residency cannot be derived from your spouse, nor a registered domestic partner. If you are an undergraduate student under the age of 24, both you and at least one of your parents must meet the residency requirements in order to be classified as a California resident for tuition and fee purposes. If you are not dependent on a California resident parent, you will be required to demonstrate financial independence, in addition to satisfying all the other residency requirements. </span></p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="hed3">Establishing Intent to Become a California Resident</h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-8dac8254-7fff-1785-a76f-f9b4e9fbc54c">Indications of your intent to make California your permanent residence can include obtaining a California driver’s license or, if you did not previously have a driver’s license from any state, a California State Identification Card; obtaining a California vehicle registration if you own and operate a vehicle in the state; registering to vote in California if you were previously registered in another state; paying California income taxes as a resident or part-year resident if you earned income in the state; designating California as your permanent address on all school and employment records, including military records if you are in the military service; establishing a California residence in which you keep your permanent belongings; licensing for professional practice in California; and the absence of these indications in other states during any period for which you claim California residency. Documentary evidence is required. All relevant indications will be considered in determining your classification. Your intent will be questioned if you return to your prior state of residence when the University is not in session.</span></p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="hed3">Financial Independence Requirement</h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-abc8d205-7fff-687e-5add-aa2b51e60b35">Effective Fall 1993, if your parents do not meet the requirements to be considered California residents for tuition and fee purposes, you will be required to demonstrate financial independence, along with physical presence and intent, when seeking a resident classification for tuition and fee purposes. You must also be in an eligible immigration status. You are considered “financially independent” if one or more of the following applies:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-abc8d205-7fff-687e-5add-aa2b51e60b35">You are a graduate or professional student, regardless of age</span></p>

If you live with neither parent, your residence is that of the parent with whom you last lived.

<p><a href="http://extension.berkeley.edu/static/studentservices/concurrent/" target="_blank">UC Berkeley Extension's Concurrent Enrollment program</a> <span id="docs-internal-guid-d97912d2-7fff-9902-991b-3a3bdd5ba962">provides an opportunity to enroll in UC Berkeley campus courses on a space-available basis without formal admission to the University. UC Berkeley degree students have enrollment priority in all courses, and not all UC Berkeley courses are open for Concurrent Enrollment applicants (e.g., classes in the School of Law are not eligible). Approval of class applications is at the sole discretion of the campus academic departments.</span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-9df194b7-7fff-b264-51b8-9f4ca7bf4861">International students may also enroll in various UC Berkeley Extension International Programs which offer concurrent enrollment programs of study and certificate options that meet full-time student eligibility requirements for F-1 visa status. </span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-9df194b7-7fff-b264-51b8-9f4ca7bf4861">Concurrent Enrollment is available only for spring and fall terms.

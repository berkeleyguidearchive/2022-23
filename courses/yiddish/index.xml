This course will trace the development of Yiddish civilization down to today from the first settlement of Jews in German lands, roughly a thousand years ago. At its peak, Yiddish was spoken over a larger European territory than any language except Russian. In fact, long before Yiddish culture came to be centered in Eastern Europe, many of the best works of Old Yiddish literature were written in Renaissance Italy. Because Jews were a highly mobile population in</span><span class="deschide"> contact with many different peoples, Yiddish was everywhere influenced by neighboring languages and became the prototypical fusion language.</span><br />

This course will trace the literary journey of Isaac Bashevis Singer (1904-1993)—the only Yiddish writer to win the Nobel Prize in Literature—from the small Polish village where he was born to the Upper West Side of Manhattan. For his American readers Singer represented a bridge between the Old World and the New, between religious tradition and American modernity. He seemed like a kindly old grandfather, telling jokes and feeding the pigeons on Broadway. But Singer</span><span class="deschide"> was a controversial figure in the Yiddish literary world: critics considered him a sellout for winning commercial success with stories about sex, immorality, and the supernatural.</span><br />

This course will trace the history of Yiddish cinema from its &quot;golden era&quot; before World War II down to today. Jews famously played a big role in the development of modern cinema, especially as Hollywood<br/>
producers and studio moguls. But although many of these moguls knew Yiddish and were themselves immigrants, they were not anxious to make Jewish films at a time of increasing anti-Semitism. During Hollywood's Golden Age, Yiddish films were not made</span><span class="deschide"> by the major studios, but independently, mainly in New Many York and Poland. The Yiddish film industry was closely linked to the world of Yiddish theater, which was enormously popular on New York's Lower East Side.</span><br />

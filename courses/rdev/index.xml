This course in intended to assist students in defining their independent capstone research project, including<br/>
the core research question(s), appropriate sources, methods, and scope, with a goal of producing<br/>
a comprehensive Capstone Proposal by the end of the course (mid-semester). Given the short time frame available for Capstone during the Summer Semester, this course is designed to prepare students to embark directly on the research and summary phases</span><span class="deschide"> of their projects at the conclusion of this course. Through lectures, assigned readings, meetings with the Instructor, much self-guided research, and the completion of three benchmark assignments this Semester, students will develop their Capstone research question and argument.</span><br/>

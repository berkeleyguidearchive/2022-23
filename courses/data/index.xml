This course engages students with fundamental questions of justice in relation to data and computing in American society. Data collection, visualization, and analysis have been entangled in the struggle for racial and social justice because they can make injustice visible, imaginable, and thus actionable. Data has also been used to oppress minoritized communities and institutionalize, rationalize, and naturalize systems of racial violence.</span><span class="deschide"> The course examines key sites of justice involving data (such as citizenship, policing, prisons, environment, and health). Along with critical social science tools, students gain introductory experience and do collaborative and creative projects with data science using real-world data.</span><br/>

An introduction to computational thinking and quantitative reasoning, preparing students for further coursework (especially Foundations of Data Science, Data 8). Emphasizes the use of computation to gain insight about quantitative problems. Uses data from various domains in the social sciences in order to develop an understanding of the societal implications of data science. Expressions, data types, collections, and tables in Python. Programming practices, abstraction</span><span class="deschide">, and iteration. The data science lifecycle. Visualizing univariate and bivariate data with bar charts, histograms, plots, and maps. Introduction to statistical concepts including averages and distributions, prediction, causality, probability, sampling, and inference.</span><br/>

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> C6 also includes quantitative reasoning concepts that aren’t covered in Data 8. These include certain topics in: principles of data visualization; simulation of random processes; and understanding numerical functions through their graphs. This will help prepare students for computational and quantitative courses other than Data 8.<br/>C6 takes advantage of the complementarity of computing and quantitative reasoning to enliven abstract ideas and build students’ confidence in their ability to solve real problems with quantitative tools. Students learn computer science concepts and immediately apply them to plot functions, visualize data, and simulate random events.<br/>
<br/>Foundations of Data Science (CS/Info/Stat C8, a.k.a. Data 8) is an increasingly popular class for entering students at Berkeley. Data 8 builds students’ computing skills in the first month of the semester, and students rely on these skills as the course progresses. For some students, particularly those with little prior exposure to computing, developing these skills benefits from further time and practice. C6 is a rapid introduction to Python programming, visualization, and data analysis, which will prepare students for success in Data 8.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Appreciate the interdisciplinary nature of data science.<br/>
Create and use visualizations to understand univariate data and to identify associations or causal relationships in bivariate data.<br/>
Formulate questions about data and perform exploratory data analysis.<br/>
Perform basic computations in Python, and be able to work with tabular data.<br/>
Run and understand basic probabilistic simulations.<br/>
Understand the syntactic structure of Python code.<br/>
Use good practices in Python programming.</p></div>

Foundations of data science from three perspectives: inferential thinking, computational thinking, and real-world relevance. Given data arising from some real-world phenomenon, how does one analyze that data so as to understand that phenomenon? The course teaches critical concepts and skills in computer programming and statistical inference, in conjunction</span><span class="deschide"> with hands-on analysis of real-world datasets, including economic data, document collections, geographical data, and social networks.

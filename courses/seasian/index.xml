The eleven nation-states that comprise the region of Southeast Asia are defined by their linguistic, cultural, economic, and sociopolitical diversity. One facet that plays a crucial role in binding this region is its environment. In order to explore both how the natural world has shaped the history of Southeast Asia and how the human relationship to the environment has changed over time, this course takes as its focus an examination of how “nature” or the environment</span><span class="deschide"> in Southeast Asia has been and is being represented through various forms of visual culture. Each week we will focus our inquiry on a different theme including: the history of Hindu/Buddhist temple architecture and the arrival of Islam and its impact on visual representation.</span><br />

This course offers an advanced introduction to the literary history, cultural norms,<br/>
poetic forms and textual traditions of 17 th  to 19 th  century Southeast Asia through a<br/>
comparative study of three epic poems:  Tum Teav (Cambodia), Khun Chang Khun<br/>
Phaen (Thailand), and Tale of Kieu (Vietnam).  We will explore the dynamics of desire<br/>
and transgression, duty and sacrifice, kinship and kingship, and the interplay between<br/>
folk, court, Buddhist</span><span class="deschide">, Confucian, and Hindu values.  Finally, we will consider the<br/>
contemporary currency and iconic status of these works in Southeast Asia and in<br/>
diaspora; what makes a national canon, and why these epic tales of love, loss and war,<br/>
remain strangers to the west.</span><br />

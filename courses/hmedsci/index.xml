This course will study the end of life--dying and death--from the perspective of medicine and history. It seeks to confront the humanist with the quotidian dilemmas of modern clinical practice and medicine's deep engagement with death more generally. It invites pre-med, pre-law, and public policy students to understand these matters in light of the historical and, more broadly, literary and artistic perspectives</span><span class="deschide"> of the humanities.</span><br />

The focus of this course is on medical physiologyâ€”the study of the human body's normal functioning. Physiology underpins the rest of the foundational medical sciences curriculum by allowing students to map and anchor the additional learning necessary to make sense of complex problem-based learning (PBL) medical cases later in the curriculum. Students will learn physiology through team-based learning (TBL), a student-centered pedagogy in which they</span><span class="deschide"> work with physiological problems to solve them collaboratively. By actively engaging in learning through problem-solving, students do more than memorize content; they learn how to work together to build a strong web of interconnected information to solve real-world problems.</span><br />

Beginning in this semester, you will learn all the foundational medical sciences through problem-based learning (PBL), which builds upon the foundation of physiological knowledge learned through TBL in your first semester. PBL is an evidence-based educational strategy underpinned by a constructivist philosophy of learning. The foundational medical sciences include, among others, pathology, pharmacology, biochemistry, immunology, microbiology</span><span class="deschide">, genetics, behavioral sciences, epidemiology, public health, medical sociology, and other social sciences.</span><br />

This graduate course aims to support the studentsâ€™ development as scholars and medical learners with a critical stance. This seminar has two components. The first is a discussion seminar focusing on 1) understanding the relationship between theory and method in designing research protocols and conducting social scientific research and 2) translating research questions into methods/research design, including appropriate measurements. The second component is</span><span class="deschide"> a practicum; students will apply the theoretical concepts, historical analyses, and conversations about methods from the seminar to the research projects that students will develop. It includes practical aspects such as writing skills, information literacy, grantsmanship, etc.</span><br />

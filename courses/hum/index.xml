This reading and writing intensive course is organized around key texts that focus on ever-widening parameters of scale: the local, the national-regional, and the global. Each level, - California, America and the Americas, and the world - is designated by representative literary texts, from those focused on the Bay Area to those reaching out to the planetary. The course fulfills the first half of the reading and composition requirement (R1A). Success in this course</span><span class="deschide"> depends upon deep reading, ongoing participation, substantive interaction with a peer review group, and steady commitment to the composition and revision of several essays.</span><br/>

This reading and writing intensive course is organized around three modules: “Old World,” dealing with the Eurasian landmass over the classical and early modern eras; “New World,” dealing with the Americas, and “Our World,” dealing with the globalized world we live in today. We will thus be exploring a series of texts organized both historically and geographically, from antiquity to the present, and from the transcontinental to the global. The course fulfills the</span><span class="deschide"> goals of the second half of the reading and composition requirement (R1B).

Mentored Research courses are designed to introduce you to the research culture on campus in a small group format. Students will work closely with faculty members and graduate-student mentors in both seminar-style cohorts and more focused groups. The courses provide mentorship, support, and feedback as students work on individual research projects. The Mentored Research course is designed for upper-division students who are getting to know research</span><span class="deschide"> resources and methods at Berkeley. Courses will provide topical instruction and responsive workshops as well as expert, individualized mentoring.<br/></span><br/>

This interdisciplinary seminar will work to bridge the gap between the two cultures of technology and the humanities. The colloquium will bring together students from both domains in discussions anchored around weekly readings. During the semester, small teams of students will present research focusing on the intersections between technology and culture. At the end of the semester, each student will write a publishable essay or research paper based on these presentations.</span><span class="deschide"> In addition to ongoing discussions, the seminar will also engage active practitioners of various types such as programmers, game designers, venture capitalists, and cultural critics.</span><br/>

Ranging across disciplines, these courses bring collaborative approaches and team-teaching to graduate studies in the humanities. Teams include faculty members from both the Division of Arts &amp; Humanities and other disciplines. In the first half of the semester, explorations and readings are organized by the team of faculty members. In the second half, the graduate students form small cohorts, each tasked with collaborating on a research</span><span class="deschide"> paper, white paper, or conference panel related to a case study. Where possible, case studies engage outside experts such as editors, curators, and policy analysts.</span><br/>

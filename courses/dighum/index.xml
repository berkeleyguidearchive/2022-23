In this course, we will evaluate a variety of digital humanities projects through theoretical scholarship in the field, in order to critically assess the value of the new knowledge that is being generated, and to weigh that knowledge in terms of traditional humanities methods. We will explore the fundamental arguments that are being advanced about these new methods and how they</span><span class="deschide"> interact with humanities’ interpretive underpinnings. This course will prepare students to apply digital methods in ethical, reflective, and responsible ways—understanding the potentials of the digital within the humanities.</span><br/>

The digital and data revolution has begun to transform the study of the humanities by introducing new archival data sources, tools and methods, and modes of analysis. In this applied course, students will use tools and data of ongoing projects associated with the Digital Humanities at Berkeley and beyond to explore the scope of the field, and to gain a foundational knowledge of</span><span class="deschide"> several digital tools through hands-on work. By the end of this course, students will have a firm grasp of the fundamentals of popular digital humanities methods such as archival methods and Text Encoding Initiative guidelines, computational text analysis, network analysis, and geospatial analysis.</span><br/>

This innovative course will introduce students to a broad range of digital humanities techniques as they are applied to issues of social justice, equality, and activism in various media. Themes or institutional focus may vary with the research background of the instructor (for example, climate change, cultural heritage, hate speech analytics). Students will be introduced to the work of relevant thought leaders and industry experts outside of the academy. A final project</span><span class="deschide"> will allow students to use one or more of these methods in a case study of their own choosing.</span><br/>

This course concentrates on doing archival research, and then building websites that organize and present the results of that research in interactive digital formats. One of the hallmarks of digital humanities is its capacity to make rare source material accessible to a broad audience in ways that simultaneously offer conceptual structure, critical analysis, and user flexibility.</span><span class="deschide"> By teaching students how to manage traditional primary sources and transform them into dynamic digital archives, this course will offer a dual training in conducting scholarly research and designing digital projects.</span><br/>

This course will explore how the power of digital tools to create complex and interactive visual representations can help us investigate problems in the humanities. Visual analysis allows for large collections of texts, artifacts and data to appear as form, distilling and presenting information in ways that are computational as well as conceptual. Spatial analysis, especially the geospatial, applies advanced digital cartographic tools to historical maps, geographically</span><span class="deschide"> based events, demography, migration, textual production, and movement over time. As with all digital humanities, these visual and spatial formats are user-responsive and open to a broad range of use.</span><br/>

This course will concentrate on one of the first and most developed techniques in the digital humanities – textual analysis – and one of the newest – natural language processing. These two methods are used to study the range of language use, spanning from the literary to the informal. While the computational power of these programs is vast, the codes they use arise from the</span><span class="deschide"> humanistic inquiries of careful readers, and are used to support critical analysis of texts. In these classes, textual and language analysis moves beyond counting and statistics to teach students to understand linguistics, genre, style, aspect, comparative analyses and literary interpretation in new ways.</span><br/>

This course will concentrate on training a critical eye on the field, and analyzing what impact the digital has on the study of the humanities and on the culture at large. Even as computational and digital capacities allow us to ask new questions, they also powerfully shape how we organize and receive knowledge. Courses in the Critical Digital Humanities will provide a necessary</span><span class="deschide"> space to critically evaluate how the modes and content of information-age technologies influence and impact the modes and content of humanistic inquiry.</span><br/>

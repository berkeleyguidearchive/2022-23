•<br/>
Calculate lift and drag of a 2D airfoil and a 3D wing in subsonic and supersonic speed regimes<br/>
•<br/>
Calculate thrust and power required for level flight<br/>
•<br/>
Compute the range and endurance of propeller-driven as well as jet-powered aircraft<br/>
•<br/>
Compute the necessary runway length for takeoff and landing<br/>
•<br/>
Analyze aircraft trim conditions<br/>
•<br/>
Assess longitudinal balance and static stability of an aircraft<br/>
•<br/>
Find orbit parameters from the orbital geometry<br/>

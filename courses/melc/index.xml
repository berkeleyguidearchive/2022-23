This course provides a multidisciplinary introduction to the Middle East, an area that has long dominated the news but remains relatively unknown to most Americans. In a broad sense, the Middle East refers to “Arab” countries in general as well as Israel, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, and the region of Kurdistan. The course aims to help students expand their knowledge and understanding of the social, economic, and cultural complexities that underlie current</span><span class="deschide"> events and politics in the Middle East. We will examine the interplay of cultures, societies, and economies of various regional communities that remain central to the dynamics of Middle Eastern identities.</span><br/>

Women have been ignored or marginalized in much of past scholarship on ancient Egypt despite their highly visible presence in and importance to ancient Egyptian society. This course examines the roles of women and gender in ancient Egyptian society and belief systems. It reviews sources of evidence and interpretive frameworks for understanding the public and private roles of women and the definition of gender in ancient Egypt. It also places the women of</span><span class="deschide"> ancient Egypt and ancient Egyptian gender constructions into comparative contexts with other ancient eastern Mediterranean and Middle Eastern societies.</span><br/>

Ancient Egypt has fascinated visitors since antiquity to our modern imagination. From mummies, pyramids, and enchanting mythologies, these fanciful ideas have made their ways into books, movies, cartoons, and music. This course will explore the way ancient Egypt has been “consumed” in the West from the Napoleonic campaign to modern pop culture. We will study the impact that ancient Egypt and its wonderful monuments and civilization has had on art, literature, music</span><span class="deschide">, and even a number of religious and spiritual movements in the West as well as in Middle Eastern and African cultures.</span><br/>

Disease is a constant of the human condition. Like health, it is both a social construct and a physical reality. Epidemics are diseases that affect very large numbers of people; pandemics are epidemics with a passport—they spread over multiple countries and often continents. In this course we will survey, compare, and contrast ancient and modern conceptions of disease and health, and medicine and doctors, and examine and evaluate what evidence exists—historical</span><span class="deschide">, textual, archaeological--for identifying epidemics and pandemics in ancient times.</span><br/>

Moreover, we will read additional ancient texts that elucidate one or another aspect of the Epic. We will follow the traditions around Gilgamesh and see how his fame</span><span class="deschide"> was used for literary, religious, and political purposes.

This course focuses on the arts of the Iranian cultural environment from the mid-first Millennium BCE through the first Millennium CE. Geographically, it covers a region stretching east from modern Iran to Afghanistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, and north towards the Central Asian steppes, the ancestral home of important ancient Iranian pastoral nomadic tribes. The course will, among others, explore the art and archaeology of the Achaemenids, Parthians, Sasanians</span><span class="deschide">, and Sogdians to come to a better understanding of the social, political, and cultural underpinnings of the pre-Islamic Iranian world.</span><br/>

The Middle East, Iran, and North Africa are home to a great number of languages and dialects, including many varieties of Arabic, as well as Persian, Kurdish, Hebrew, Aramaic, Berber, and more. This course provides an introduction to the current status of these languages, their social settings, and relevant parts of their histories. Students will acquire a basic foundation in sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology as we explore how these languages change, struggle</span><span class="deschide">, and thrive. Knowledge of a language from the region (e.g. Arabic or Persian) will be helpful; no background in linguistics is required.</span><br/>

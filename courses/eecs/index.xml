An introduction to digital and system design. The material provides a top-down view of the principles, components, and methodologies for large scale digital system design. The underlying CMOS devices and manufacturing technologies are introduced, but quickly abstracted to higher-levels to focus the class on design of larger digital modules for both FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays) and ASICs (application specific integrated circuits). The</span><span class="deschide"> class includes extensive use of industrial grade design automation and verification tools for assignments, labs and projects.<br/>
The class has two lab options: ASIC Lab (<span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="EECS 151LA">EECS 151LA</span>) and FPGA Lab (<span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="EECS 151LB">EECS 151LB</span>). Students must enroll in at least one of the labs concurrently with the class.</span><br/>

An introduction to digital circuit and system design. The material provides a top-down view of the principles, components, and methodologies for large scale digital system design. The underlying CMOS devices and manufacturing technologies are introduced, but quickly abstracted to higher levels to focus the class on design of larger digital modules for both FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays) and ASICs (application specific integrated circuits).</span><span class="deschide"> The class includes extensive use of industrial grade design automation and verification tools for assignments, labs, and projects.</span><br/>

A series of lab exercises provide the background and practice of digital design using a modern FPGA design tool flow. Digital synthesis, partitioning, placement, routing, and simulation tools for FPGAs are covered in detail. The labs exercises culminate with a large design project, e.g., an implementation of a full 3-stage RISC-V processor</span><span class="deschide"> system, with caches, graphics acceleration, and external peripheral components.

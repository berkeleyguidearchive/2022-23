This course is designed to introduce mid-career executives to three things: a typology of “kinds of problems” that confront those leading organizations; a sampling of major problems confronting leaders in the next decades; and a sampling of solutions to problems confronting leaders. It introduces the rest of the Berkeley MPA summer core program with examples of the kinds of problems that modern leaders must confront and the kinds of solutions</span><span class="deschide"> that must be devised. The course features at least one article or book by a GSPP faculty member in each session except the last.</span><br/>

There is increasing emphasis throughout the public and non-profit sectors to invest in practices that are “evidence based&quot;. In this course, we are going to study the role of empirical research in public decision making and the common research strategies employed to study problems of causal inference and prediction. The effectiveness of specific intervention often relies on research attempting to demonstrate</span><span class="deschide"> that one variable (for example, a particular educational intervention) has a causal effect on an outcome of interest (for example, successful completion of high school). We will study the various research strategies that are employed to uncover causal effects and to evaluate the effects of programmatic interventions.</span><br/>

Program evaluation is the systematic investigation of social programs, regulations, or policies. The aim of program evaluation is to provide valid findings in order to determine whether a particular program or policy is achieving its objectives. Evaluations are used for various reasons, most commonly to aid in decisions concerning whether programs should be continued, improved, expanded, or curtailed. This course will introduce students to a variety of research</span><span class="deschide"> designs and related methodological tools useful for evaluating the impact of public policies and programs.</span><br/>

Inspirational and authentic leaders understand that in order to inspire and earn the trusts of others, they must first be willing to reveal who they are and what they truly believe in. In this course, we will study how leaders and change agents use storytelling to inspire people and enroll others into their vision. More importantly, you will have the opportunity to discover and tell your own leadership stories—who</span><span class="deschide"> you are, your personal beliefs and values, and your personal/professional aspirations and passion. The goal of the course is to provide the foundations to develop both the content and the delivery of a compelling story.</span><br/>

The objective of this course is to assess the strengths and weaknesses of ethical arguments in the process and substance of policymaking. Those who seek to govern well inescapably confront questions of value in their political, professional and personal choices. The discussion of ethical dilemmas is designed to provoke analytic reflection on the moral challenges and responsibilities</span><span class="deschide"> for public policymaking in a democracy. The focus is on the many and often competing obligations, commitments and values that should guide public actors, as well as on the public principles that guide the design of good public policy.</span><br/>

This course focuses on creating and implementing change within public organizations through the application of strategic planning, innovation and leadership. We will discuss where new ideas come from and how they can be generated, evaluated and implemented. The methods developed in other parts of the summer curriculum become the support for proving that new ideas are good ideas (or for finding out that they are</span><span class="deschide"> bad ideas). We will explore how each method can be useful to a leader (both formal and informal) at various levels within a public organization through case studies and real world examples.

In the Fourth Industrial Revolution, emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and gene editing will transform the way we work and the way we live. The speed, scope, and scale of the technological changes are unprecedented, which pose serious challenges to policy makers – how do you create agile public policies to not only keep up with technologies, but to anticipate future trends in this fast-moving digital economy? We will take a practical</span><span class="deschide"> approach to examine the issues and challenges of “tech policy” from a global perspective, including topics such as digital trade, data privacy, digital payment, artificial intelligence, gene editing, blockchain, and more.</span><br/>

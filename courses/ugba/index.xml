Consumer psychology is the systematic study of how consumers perceive information, how they encode it in memory</span><span class="deschide">, integrate it with other sources of information, retrieve it from memory, and utilize it to make decisions.

This is a project-based course in collaborative innovation where students experience group creativity and team-based design by using techniques from across the disciplines of business, theater, design, and art practice. Students will leverage problem framing and solving techniques derived from critical thinking, systems thinking, and creative problem solving (popularly known today as design thinking). The course is grounded in a brief weekly lecture that</span><span class="deschide"> sets out the theoretical, historical, and cultural contexts for particular innovation practices, but the majority of the class involves hands-on studio-based learning guided by an interdisciplinary team of teachers leading small group collaborative projects.</span><br />

This is a high-octane, single weekend course (plus one intro day) for students interested in meeting other innovators and getting hands-on experience developing a new impact startup concept. All “social and environmental” impact themes are welcome. The course is inspired by other “hackathon” and startup weekend formats. A structured roadmap helps guide students through a sprint formation and ideation process. All students will be asked to submit an idea</span><span class="deschide"> during the week prior to the class. After a peer vote selects the top ideas, teams are organically formed during the first session. At the end of the course, each team will present their validated concept and their next steps plan to a panel of impact venture experts.</span><br />

This course covers the methods and applications of impact evaluations, which is the science of measuring the causal impact of a program or policy on outcomes of interest. At its essence, impact evaluation is about generating evidence on which policies work, and which don’t. This subject matter should appeal to three main audiences: (1) those in decision-making positions, such as policy makers and business leaders, and need to consume the information generated from</span><span class="deschide"> impact evaluations to make informed evidence-based decisions, (2) project managers, development practitioners and business managers who commission impact evaluations and (3) researchers who actually design and implement impact evaluations.</span><br />

Students are taught to identify opportunities to create business value from environmental and social challenges</span><span class="deschide">, and to evaluate the competitive implications related to sustainability initiatives. What type of long-term strategies can organizations set to simultaneously foster sustainable development strategy and sound financial practice? How should decision makers make trade-offs between these two organizational objectives? When is “sustainability” also “good business”?</span><br />

Energy is one of the main drivers of civilization. Today we are at the precipice of what many hope will be a major paradigm shift in energy production and use. Two transitions are needed. On the one hand, we must find ways to extend the benefits of our existing energy system to the impoverished people living in the developing world while continuing to provide these benefits to the people of the developed world. On the other hand, we must completely</span><span class="deschide"> overhaul the existing system to fight climate change and other forms of air and water pollution.

This course will teach anyone how to start to be a designer, not just of drawings and objects, but also buildings, landscapes, and urban spaces. And not just in isolation, but in the complex web of ecological and man-made systems which makes up our shifting environment. You will take from the course first-hand experience of drawing, measuring, and design — which form the basis of the professions of architecture, landscape architecture</span><span class="deschide">, and urban planning— and which culminate in a final design project in the course. The course is open to all undergraduate students.</span><br />

The Summer [IN]STITUTE consists of four cohorts, each an introductory course for participants with no previous experience in environmental design: [IN]ARCH, [IN]ARCH ADV, [IN]CITY and [IN]LAND. Institute participants explore the methods and theories of the environmental design disciplines, experience the culture of design and planning studios, connect to faculty and practitioners</span><span class="deschide">, and build a portfolio for graduate school application. Each program includes a lecture series, a design or planning studio, a media seminar, and site visits.

This study of cities is more important than ever; for the first time in history more people live in urban than rural areas, and cities will account for all of the world's population growth for at least the next half-century. We will explore the challenges facing global cities in the 21st Century and expose students to some of the key texts, theories, and methods of inquiry that shape the built environment, from the human scale of home and</span><span class="deschide"> community to the regional scale of the megacity.</span><br />

This course explores cities and landscapes as layered repositories of history, both ecological and human. Examining environmental design history and practice, it highlights how deep time legacies are acknowledged or ignored in placemaking, including racialized spatial histories. In addressing the role of architecture, city planning, and landscape design in shaping places and giving them meaning, the course explores the diversity of spatially defined experiences</span><span class="deschide"> and the ways in which they are shaped by policy and professional practice. Case studies on Bay Area urban and social geography are linked with transnational histories and design movements to highlight the larger forces that have shaped the local historical and social landscape.</span><br />

Students will propose ways of representing history in public space as a way to shape future histories. We will explore the concept of “public history” and study artistic and</span><span class="deschide"> literary representations of the past. We will consider the ways that city planning and urban design have used or ignored memory and meaning. Highlighting landscapes shaped by economic inequality, migration, incarceration, and racism, we will analyze what is hidden, forgotten, missing, or in need of representation.</span><br />

This course explores relationships between data, design and activism, raising critical questions about what data and data analytics are; what design is; and how both data and design can serve to protect the status quo as well as become agents of change. In turn, the course also surveys the ways in which activism has historically played a role in data analysis and design practice at the scales of planning, architecture, landscape, and cities.<br/>
Through lectures</span><span class="deschide">, readings, and exercises, students explore data/design activism or the use of data analytics and design interventions to catalyze change.</span><br />

First, we will examine the main tenets of critical race theory to address the structural roots and history of injustice. Second, students will learn the theory, methodology and practice of transformative community planning, design and public policy principles that center the lived experiences, experiential</span><span class="deschide"> knowledge, and agency of people directly impacted by systemic injustice. Third, we will examine the role of individual and collective healing focusing on the principles of restorative justice.

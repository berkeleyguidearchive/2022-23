<h2>Introduction to the College</h2>




<p>The College of Environmental Design (CED) is UC Berkeley’s home for environmental design theory, research, innovation, and practice. CED stands among the nation’s top environmental design and planning schools. It is one of the world’s most distinguished laboratories for experimentation, research, and intellectual synergy. CED offers undergraduate degrees in architecture, urban studies, landscape architecture, and sustainable environmental design. All departments offer undergraduate minor programs open to students majoring in other fields.</p>




<p>The mission of CED is to educate diverse students to critically analyze the built environment, preparing them to craft buildings, cities, and landscapes that are ecologically sustainable and resilient; prosperous and fair; healthy and beautiful.</p>




<p><span class="m_-1813168428243533000gmail-">The College trains students in </span>rigorous research and analytic methods, as well as the art of designing memorable, well-loved places that both nurture the senses and challenge the imagination. CED helps students acquire technical expertise and develop transcendent ways of seeing and re-figuring the built environment.</p>

You satisfy the requirement by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, an American Cultures course. You may take an American Cultures course any time during your undergraduate career at Berkeley. The requirement was instituted in 1991 to introduce students to the diverse cultures of the United States through a comparative framework. Courses are offered in more than fifty departments in many different disciplines at both the lower and upper division level.</span></p> <div> </div>

<h3>University of California Requirements<br/>
 </h3>
<p><a href="/2022-23/undergraduate/colleges-schools/environmental-design/entry-level-writing-requirement/">Entry Level Writing</a></p>
<p>All students who will enter the University of California as freshmen must demonstrate their command of the English language by satisfying the Entry Level Writing Requirement. satisfaction of this requirement is also a prerequisite to enrollment in all reading and composition courses at UC Berkeley. </p>
<p><a href="/2022-23/undergraduate/colleges-schools/environmental-design/american-history-american-institutions-requirements/">American History and American Institutions</a></p>
<p>The American History and Institutions requirements are based on the principle that a U.S. resident graduated from an American university should have an understanding of the history and governmental institutions of the United States.</p>
<h3>Campus Requirement</h3>
<p><a href="/2022-23/undergraduate/colleges-schools/environmental-design/american-cultures-requirement/">American Cultures</a></p>
<p>American Cultures (AC) is the one requirement that all undergraduate students at UC Berkeley need to take and pass in order to graduate. The requirement offers an exciting intellectual environment centered on the study of race, ethnicity and culture of the United States. AC courses offer students opportunities to be part of research-led, highly accomplished teaching environments, grappling with the complexity of American Culture.</p>
<h3>College Requirements</h3>
<h4><a href="/2022-23/undergraduate/colleges-schools/environmental-design/reading-composition-requirement/">Reading and Composition</a></h4>
<p>In order to provide a solid foundation in reading, writing, and critical thinking, the College requires two semesters of lower division work in composition. Students must complete a first-level reading and composition course by the end of their second semester and a second-level course by the end of their fourth semester. CED students admitted to UCB as freshmen must complete the first half of the R&amp;C requirement at Berkeley.</p>
<h4><span>Seven Course Breadth</span></h4>
<p><span class="s1">Please see <span class="s2"><a href="/2022-23/undergraduate/colleges-schools/letters-science/#breadthrequirementstextcontainer" target="_blank">College of Letters &amp; Science Seven-Course Breadth Requirement</a> for detailed instructions on satisfying these requirements</span>. </span><span>Guidelines include the following:</span></p>
<ol>
	<li>Up to two CED courses or courses cross-listed with CED may be used to complete Seven-Course Breadth (students admitted to UCB Fall 2013 and later only).</li>
	<li>Only lower division ENV DES courses (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ENV%20DES%201" title="ENV DES 1" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ENV DES 1');">ENV DES 1</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ENV%20DES%205" title="ENV DES 5" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ENV DES 5');">ENV DES 5</a></span>) and lower division major requirements may simultaneously satisfy Seven-Course Breadth. A course used to satisfy either an upper division major requirement or the upper division CED outside of architecture requirement may not also satisfy Seven Course Breadth. Upper division CED courses that are not satisfying another upper division requirement may satisfy Seven-Course Breadth.</li>
	<li>No more than two courses from any one academic department may be used to satisfy breadth requirements.</li>
	<li>A Seven-Course Breadth class that is also being used to complete another CED requirement must be completed with a letter grade of C- or better.</li>
	<li>Only one of the remaining Seven-Course Breadth may be taken on a Passed/Not Passed basis.</li>
	<li>The International Studies breadth requirement may be satisfied by participation in the UC Education Abroad Program or a recognized equivalent program.</li>
	<li>CED students may apply high school exam credit (Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, A-Level Exam) towards many of the above requirements. See the CED website section on High School Exam Credit for more information: <a href="http://ced.berkeley.edu/ced/students/undergraduate-advising/forms-documents/" target="_blank">http://ced.berkeley.edu/ced/students/undergraduate-advising/forms-documents/</a></li>

<p>Students admitted as freshmen must graduate within eight fall/spring semesters at UC Berkeley. Students admitted as transfer students must graduate within four fall/spring semesters at UC Berkeley. EAP and UCDC count towards this semester limit; summer session, UC Extension, and study abroad through non-UC programs do not. Students approved for simultaneous degrees in two colleges may be granted an additional semester. CED does not limit the number of total units a student can accrue.</p>
<h3>Grade Requirements</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A 2.0 UC GPA is required for graduation.</li>
	<li>A 2.0 GPA within the major is required at time of graduation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Graduating With Honors</h3>
<p>To graduate with distinction, students must meet the grade point average (GPA) requirement and complete at least 50 units in residence at Berkeley (this may include UCB Extension XB units and up to 20 units from UCDC or EAP), of which 43 units must be letter-graded (not including physical education activities courses). <em>Transfer students must make sure they complete 50 units at Berkeley to qualify for honors.</em></p>
<p>Students' GPA in all letter-graded courses taken at Berkeley must be equal to or higher than the GPA established for honors in the year in which they graduate. These GPA cut-offs change slightly each year and are posted on the CED website.</p>
<h3>Unit Requirements</h3>
<p>Students must complete at least 120 semester units of courses subject to certain guidelines:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A maximum of 16 units of Special Studies coursework (courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, 198, or 199) is allowed towards the 120 units; a maximum of four is allowed in a given semester; only upper division students (60 or more units completed) may enroll in 197, 198, or 199 coursework.</li>
	<li>A maximum of 4 units of Physical Education from any school attended will count towards the 120 units.</li>
	<li>Students may receive unit credit for courses graded P (including P/NP units taken through EAP) up to a limit of one-third of the total units taken and passed on the Berkeley campus at the time of graduation.</li>
	<li>No more than 60 units from a single department can be used towards the 120 minimum.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Semester Unit Minimum</h4>
<p>All CED students must enroll in at least 12 units each fall and spring semester. (Students entering UC Berkeley as freshmen with no prior units need to complete 15 units per semester to graduate in four years.)</p>
<h4>Semester Unit Maximum</h4>
<p>To request permission to take more than 20.5 units in a semester, please see the major advisor.</p>
<h4>Senior Residence Requirement</h4>
<p>After reaching senior status (90 semester units earned), students must be registered in the College of Environmental Design and must complete at least 24 of the remaining 30 units in at least two semesters in residence at UC Berkeley as CED students. To count as residence, a semester must consist of at least six passed units.</p>
<p>Students may use Berkeley Summer Sessions to satisfy one semester of the Senior Residence Requirement, provided that six units of coursework are completed. Units completed through UC Berkeley “W” web-based courses do apply towards Senior Residence.</p>
<p><em>Excluded from Senior Residence:</em> Inter-campus Visitor Program, Education Abroad Program (UCEAP), UC Berkeley Washington Program (UCDC), Berkeley Summer Sessions completed abroad, UC Berkeley Extension units (X and XB), and non-UC Berkeley online classes.</p>
<h4>Modified Senior Residence Requirement</h4>
<p>Participants in the UC Berkeley-Washington Program (UCDC); a fall, spring or summer UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP); Berkeley Summer Abroad; or the Berkeley Global Internship program may meet the Modified Senior Residence Requirement by completing 24 of their final 60 semester units(excluding EAP or UC Extension) in residence. Note that these programs must consist of at least six passed units to meet the requirement. At least 12 of the 24 units must be completed after senior status (90 units) is reached.</p>
<p>Most students automatically satisfy the residence requirement by attending classes here for four years (two years for transfer students). In general, there is no need to be concerned about this requirement, unless students go abroad for a semester or year or want to take courses at another institution or through University Extension during their senior year. In these cases, students should make an appointment to see an advisor to determine how they can meet the Senior Residence Requirement.</p>
<h4>Fulfilling Requirements with Transfer Coursework </h4>
<p>Students may use transfer work, including courses taken via Study Abroad, to fulfill CED requirements, within the following limits (please consult your major advisor for more information):</p>
<ul>
	<li>Upper Division Major Requirements: Up to two courses taken elsewhere may be applied, if deemed transferable by the UC Berkeley <a href="https://ceu.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Central Evaluation Unit</a> and approved by the faculty advisor for your major.</li>
	<li>Upper Division CED Outside the Major: Up to two courses taken elsewhere may be applied, if deemed transferable by the UC Berkeley <a href="https://ceu.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Central Evaluation Unit</a>  and approved by the college.</li>
	<li>Upper Division CED Minor Requirements: Up to two courses taken elsewhere may be applied, if deemed transferable by the UC Berkeley <a href="https://ceu.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Central Evaluation Unit</a>  and approved by the faculty advisor for your minor.</li>
	<li>CED Breadth Requirements: All requirements can be potentially fulfilled by courses taken elsewhere, if deemed transferable by the UC Berkeley <a href="https://ceu.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Central Evaluation Unit</a>  and approved for breadth by the college (courses must be at least three units each).</li>
</ul>
<p>To submit a request, please refer to the CED Forms &amp; Documents page and complete the form located under Transfer Credit Evaluation: &quot;CED Course Substitution Process-Current Students (Including Study Abroad).&quot;</p>
<h4>Concurrent Enrollment </h4>
<p>Concurrent enrollment for enrolled Berkeley students is defined as a student being enrolled in courses at UC Berkeley during a Fall or Spring semester, while also being enrolled in courses at another school such as a California community college. Students who wish to take courses concurrently must seek approval from CED Advising <strong>four weeks prior to the first day of instruction</strong>. Students who do not have approval from CED Advising will not be approved to post transferable units to their UC Berkeley academic transcript. Only summer session enrollment does not require approval from CED Advising.</p>

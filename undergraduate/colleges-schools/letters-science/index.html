<h2>Introduction to the College</h2>




<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-5ed62535-7fff-6a36-f2c6-3a33eb62288b">The College of Letters &amp; Science is the great, big heart of UC Berkeley: great because our international stature is the core of the university’s intellectual preeminence, and big because we are by far the largest of Berkeley’s colleges, comprising 38 departments and offering more than 80 majors across an extraordinary range of disciplines.  </span></p>




<p>Our rigorous academic programs are second to none and our capacity for impact far exceeds that of our private peers — every year 6,000 talented people graduate from our college, ready to lead change for the greater good.</p>




<p>L&amp;S is for all of us and we are committed to making our community as welcoming and respectful as it is intellectually stimulating.</p>

As the foundation of a liberal arts education, breadth courses give students a view into the intellectual life of the University while introducing them to a multitude of perspectives and approaches to research and scholarship. Engaging students in new disciplines and with peers from other majors, the breadth experience strengthens interdisciplinary connections and provides context that prepares Berkeley graduates to understand and solve the complex issues of their day.</span></p>
<p><span>The requirement consists of seven distribution areas:<strong> Arts and Literature, Biological Science, Historical Studies, International Studies, Philosophy and Values, Physical Science, and Social and Behavioral Sciences.</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>For descriptions of these distribution areas, as well as a more information on options to complete breadth, visit the <a href="https://lsadvising.berkeley.edu/seven-course-breadth" target="_blank">L&amp;S Seven-Course Breadth</a> webpage.</span></p>
<h3><span>Guidelines for Seven-Course Breadth</span></h3>
<p>Complete one approved course for each of the seven areas with a minimum grade of C- or P. To find course options for breadth, go to the <a class="ext" href="http://classes.berkeley.edu/">Class Schedule</a>, select the term of interest, and use the &quot;Breadth Requirements&quot; filter to select the breadth area(s) of interest.  When selecting a course, keep the following in mind:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Some courses may list multiple breadth areas. These are <em>options</em> for which breadth areas the course can satisfy. A course may only be used for <em>one</em> of the approved breadth areas. To satisfy the breadth requirement, complete seven distinct courses, one for each breadth area.</li>
	<li>Students may use up to two courses from any one academic department to satisfy the Seven-Course Breadth. This includes all <a href="https://lsadvising.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/depts_multiple_subjects_02_02_22.pdf">subject areas offered by the department</a> and—if a course is cross-listed (indicated by a 'C' prefix)—all other departments offering the course as well. <a href="/2022-23/courses/l_s/" target="_blank">Letters and Science (&quot;LS&quot;)</a> courses are an exception to this restriction. Students may complete as many LS courses as they wish for the Seven-Course Breadth. This includes LS courses offered through the <a class="ext" href="http://lsdiscovery.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Discovery</a> and <a class="ext" href="http://bigideascourses.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Big Ideas</a> programs. </li>
	<li>Courses fulfilling <a class="ext" href="/2022-23/undergraduate/colleges-schools/letters-science/american-history-institutions-requirement/" target="_blank">American History &amp; Institutions</a>, <a class="ext" href="http://americancultures.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">American Cultures</a> or requirements in the major program may also be applied to the Seven-Course Breadth requirement.</li>
	<li>Exams, such as Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate exams, cannot be used to fulfill breadth requirements.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Satisfying the Seven Course Breadth Requirement with Transfer Work</h3>
<ul>
	<li>All transfer courses must be completed with a grade of C- or better, or the equivalent of a Passed grade on the host campus, in order to be considered for Seven-Course Breadth. </li>
	<li>To be eligible for consideration, the minimum unit requirement for a course offered from a campus on the semester system is 3.0 units, and for courses offered from campuses on the quarter system, 4.0 units.</li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-adb2dc41-7fff-dd50-4472-2e94acbbecb4">Students can complete pre-approved breadth courses at a California Community College. Pre-approved courses can be found on </span><a href="http://www.assist.org/web-assist/welcome.html">ASSIST</a>. Refer to the <a href="https://lsadvising.berkeley.edu/progress-planning/transfer-credit">L&amp;S Transfer Coursework page</a> for instructions on how to take transfer credit as an L&amp;S student before enrolling at a California Community College.</li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-a00a21c8-7fff-9d81-db65-e09d3f789e75">Successful completion of transferable courses from other higher education institutions (i.e. 2-year or 4-year campus in the U.S. or non-UCEAP courses from abroad) may also be considered. Course descriptions and syllabi will be required to make a breadth determination. For more information on pursuing transfer courses for Seven-Course Breadth at another higher education institution, review L&amp;S’s </span><a href="https://lsadvising.berkeley.edu/progress-planning/transfer-credit/other-higher-education-institution">Transfer Credit: Other Higher Education Institutions</a> webpage.</li>

<h3>L&amp;S College Advisers </h3>
<p>We can help you understand college requirements and academic rules and procedures. We also help students explore their interests, <a href="https://lsadvising.berkeley.edu/discover-connect">discover opportunities, and connect with the campus</a>. L&amp;S College Advisers can support you in finding a major, navigating unexpected hurdles, and enhancing your undergraduate experience. </p>
<p>Below are common topics you would discuss with an L&amp;S College Adviser:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Satisfying College requirements, including Essential Skills and the Seven-Course Breadth</li>
	<li>Choosing a major or minor</li>
	<li>Exploring transfer work options for college requirements</li>
	<li>Clarifying academic options if you are struggling with a class</li>
	<li>Incorporating college requirements and enrichment opportunities to a 4-year plan </li>
	<li>Connecting with campus resources for support and enrichment opportunities</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Advising Neighborhood model will help you connect with L&amp;S College Advisers who are more familiar with your intended/declared major. It will also help you more easily find Undergraduate Major Advisers for your major-specific questions. Advisers in these neighborhoods will work closely together to give you a more consistent and holistic academic advising experience during your time at Cal. </p>

				<a name="academicopportunitiestext"></a><h2>Academic Opportunities</h2><p><a href="http://bigideascourses.berkeley.edu/">Big Ideas Courses</a><span>, launched in 2012, bring together two or more faculty members from different disciplines to co-teach innovative breadth courses. Big Ideas Courses take up key intellectual and societal challenges that cannot be adequately addressed by the perspective or methodology of one discipline alone. For more information, visit the </span><a href="http://bigideascourses.berkeley.edu/">website</a><span>.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://calteach.berkeley.edu/">Cal Teach</a> is a program for undergraduate science, math, and engineering majors interested in exploring a career in education. Through our courses, students learn conceptual teaching skills and practice these methods in local K-12 classrooms. Cal Teach offers the minor in Science and Math Education, as well as a unique opportunity for students to complete both a degree and a California teaching credential as an undergraduate.</p>
<p><a href="http://fss.berkeley.edu/">Freshman and Sophomore Seminars</a> arose from the conviction that early intellectual contact with faculty members would greatly enhance the undergraduate experience at Berkeley. Professors from nearly every campus department join together each semester to offer an impressive array of seminars. The courses numbered 24 bear one unit of credit; they are limited to 15 students and freshmen are given priority for enrollment. The courses numbered 84 bear one or two units of credit; they are limited to 15 sophomores. The courses numbered 39A-39Z are limited to 25 freshmen and sophomores.</p>
<p>Seminars, which emphasize interaction and discussion, provide a counterpoint to the learning experience in Berkeley's large lecture halls. These seminars also offer lower division students an unprecedented opportunity to explore a wide range of majors and even fields of study usually reserved for graduate students. As you browse through this Guide<em>,</em> you will find lower division seminars sponsored by Letters and Science departments, as well as by the professional schools and colleges. Descriptions of all the seminars scheduled for the upcoming semester can be found on the program's website, which also contains other useful information and features for undergraduates. For additional information regarding the Freshman and Sophomore Seminars, <span id="docs-internal-guid-fa80b6c5-7fff-0927-66a3-df24d9f1d4cd">visit the </span><a href="https://fss.berkeley.edu/">website</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://lsdiscovery.berkeley.edu/">Letters and Science Discovery Courses</a> are exemplary breadth courses, designed to engage and broaden the minds of non-experts. Taught by some of the most distinguished faculty members on campus, the L&amp;S Discovery Courses are guaranteed to deliver a high-quality educational experience.</p>
<p><a href="http://onthesamepage.berkeley.edu">On the Same Page</a> is a campus-wide book-in-common program, designed to welcome new freshmen and transfer students into the intellectual dialogue that characterizes the Berkeley campus. Each year all of the faculty and all new students receive a book (or film or other study object) that provides the focus for discussions, courses, events, and activities in the fall term. For more information, visit the <a href="http://onthesamepage.berkeley.edu">website.</a> For the most up-to-date information, follow On the Same Page on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/On-the-Same-Page-12900743724/">facebook</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/UCOnthesamepage?lang=en">twitter</a>. </p>
<p><a href="http://scholarships.berkeley.edu/">Scholarship Connection</a> administers the application process for over a dozen prestigious external scholarships (such as the Rhodes, Marshall, Truman, and Goldwater scholarships) and offers a clearinghouse for information on 500+ other external scholarships.

<p><a href="http://research.berkeley.edu">The Office of Undergraduate Research and Scholarships</a> (OURS) helps students get engaged in research while at Cal: connecting with faculty and mentors, obtaining funding opportunities to support your research pursuits, and integrating research with your other academic goals. Research programs run directly by OURS include the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Apprentice with Faculty:</strong> The <a href="http://urap.berkeley.edu">Undergraduate Research Apprentice Program</a> (URAP) provides opportunities for you to receive course credit to work with faculty on cutting-edge research projects during the academic year. Approximately 1,500 students and 300+ faculty members participate each semester.</li>
	<li><strong>Independent research:</strong> The <a href="http://surf.berkeley.edu/">Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships</a>  (SURF L&amp;S and SURF Rose Hills) fund over 100 students each summer with stipends from $4,500–$6,000 to carry out research projects. In addition, the <a href="http://hsp.berkeley.edu/">Haas Scholars Program</a> funds twenty students a year, with stipends up to $13,800 for independent research. These programs are primarily designed for juniors intending to do research over the summer to support their thesis work. </li>
	<li><strong>Public service: </strong>The <a href="http://stronach.berkeley.edu/">Stronach Baccalaureate Prize</a> funds four to six recent Cal grads for up to $25,000 to carry out a public service project of their own designs.</li>

<h3><span>Guidelines for Quantitative Reasoning Courses</span></h3>

 

<p>The Quantitative Reasoning requirement is designed to ensure that students graduate with basic understanding and competency in mathematics, statistics, or computer science. The requirement may be satisfied by exam or by taking an approved course. Course work used to satisfy Quantitative Reasoning must be completed with a letter grade of C- or higher. </p>

<h3>Satisfying Quantitative Requirement with a Transfer Course</h3>

 

<p><em>All transfer courses pursued for Quantitative Reasoning must be completed with a C- or higher. </em></p>

 

<ul> 	<li>Students admitted with IGETC Certification or UC Reciprocity have satisfied Quantitative Reasoning. No additional course work is required.</li> 	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-351a9187-7fff-6a26-ef5e-0ed0163e11c4">Students can complete a pre-approved Quantitative Reasoning course at a California Community College. Pre-approved courses can be found on </span><a href="http://www.assist.org/web-assist/welcome.html">ASSIST</a>. Refer to the <a href="https://lsadvising.berkeley.edu/progress-planning/transfer-credit">L&amp;S Transfer Coursework page</a> for instructions on how to take transfer credit as an L&amp;S student before enrolling at a California Community College. 	<ul> 		<li>UC Berkeley Extension course STAT X10, Math X11, Math X12 are additional pre-approved transfer course options for Quantitative Reasoning.</li> 	</ul> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-11d43547-7fff-85e4-ab81-d2fc9b7f29e8">Successful completion of transferable courses from other higher education institutions (i.e. 2-year or 4-year campus in the U.S. or non-UCEAP courses from abroad) may also be considered. Course descriptions and syllabi will be required to make a determination. For more information on pursuing transfer courses for Quantitative Reasoning at another higher education institution, review L&amp;S’s </span><a href="https://lsadvising.berkeley.edu/progress-planning/transfer-credit/other-higher-education-institution">Transfer Credit: Other Higher Education Institutions</a> webpage. </p> 	</li> </ul>

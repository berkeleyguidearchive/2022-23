<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-bdd0590d-7fff-1907-89f6-8070d8573299">The Division of Undergraduate Studies, serving approximately 21,000 students at UC Berkeley, provides great courses for undergraduates, helps students with advice, and lets students explore interdisciplinary questions with unique majors.</span></p>




<p>Undergraduate Studies has three components: Academic Engagement Programs, Undergraduate Advising, and Undergraduate &amp; Interdisciplinary Studies.</p>




<a name="academicengagementprograms"></a>
<h3>Academic Engagement Programs</h3>




<p><strong>The Office of Curricular Engagement Initiatives</strong> supports college and campus-wide programs that are designed to promote the ideals of a liberal arts education. Our curricular and co-curricular programs serve students at every stage of their undergraduate careers from the initial years of intellectual exploration through the process of pursuing an in-depth academic focus.</p>




<p style="margin-left:40px"><strong><a href="http://bigideascourses.berkeley.edu/">Big Ideas Courses</a></strong> bring together two or more faculty members from different disciplines to co-teach innovative breadth courses. Big Ideas Courses take up key intellectual and societal challenges that cannot be adequately addressed by the perspective or methodology of one discipline alone. </p>




<p style="margin-left:40px"><strong><a href="http://fss.berkeley.edu/">Freshman and Sophomore Seminars</a></strong> arose from the conviction that early intellectual contact with faculty members would greatly enhance the undergraduate experience at Berkeley. Professors from nearly every campus department join together each semester to offer an impressive array of seminars. The courses numbered 24 bear one unit of credit; they are limited to 15 students and freshmen are given priority for enrollment. The courses numbered 84 bear one or two units of credit; they are limited to 15 sophomores. The courses numbered 39A-39Z are limited to 25 freshmen and sophomores. Seminars, which emphasize interaction and discussion, provide a counterpoint to the learning experience in Berkeley's large lecture halls. These seminars also offer lower-division students an unprecedented opportunity to explore a wide range of majors and even fields of study usually reserved for graduate students. As you browse through this Guide<em>,</em> you will find lower-division seminars sponsored by Letters and Science departments, as well as by the professional schools and colleges. Descriptions of all the seminars scheduled for the upcoming semester can be found on the program's website, which also contains other useful information and features for undergraduates. </p>




<p style="margin-left:40px"><strong><a href="http://lsdiscovery.berkeley.edu/">Letters and Science Discovery Courses</a></strong> are exemplary breadth courses taught by some of the most distinguished faculty members on campus. Designed to engage and broaden the minds of non-experts, the L&amp;S Discovery Courses are guaranteed to deliver a high-quality educational experience.</p>




<p style="margin-left:40px"><strong><a href="http://onthesamepage.berkeley.edu/">On the Same Page</a></strong> is a campus-wide program designed to welcome new freshmen and transfer students into the intellectual dialogue that characterizes the Berkeley campus. Each year all of the faculty and all new students receive a book (or film or other study object) that provides the focus for discussions, courses, events, and activities in the fall term. </p>




<p style="margin-left:40px"><a href="https://ls1w.berkeley.edu/"><strong>L&amp;S 1: Exploring the Liberal Arts</strong></a> is a course that provides entering students an introduction to the intellectual landscape of the College of Letters &amp; Science, the campus's liberal arts college. Guest speakers, primarily the faculty and recent graduates of L&amp;S, shed light on the nature and attractions of their disciplines. The goal of the course is to transform students into informed participants in their own educational experiences at UC Berkeley. </p>




<p><a href="http://research.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank"><strong>The Office of Undergraduate Research and Scholarships</strong></a> (OURS) helps students pursue various research opportunities while at Cal. OURS works to connect students with faculty and mentors, help students obtain funding to support their research, and facilitate the integration of research with students' other <span class="il">academic</span> goals. Programs run directly by OURS include the following:</p>




<p style="margin-left:40px"><a href="http://urap.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank"><strong>Undergraduate Research Apprentice Program</strong></a> (URAP) provides opportunities for students to receive course credit by working with faculty and staff researchers on cutting-edge research projects during the <span class="il">academic</span> year. Approximately 1,700 students and 325+ faculty members and researchers participate each semester.</p>




<p style="margin-left:40px"><a href="https://surf.berkeley.edu/"><strong>Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships</strong></a> (SURF L&amp;S, SURF Rose Hills, SURF-SMART) provide over 100 students each summer with $5000 stipends to carry out their proposed research projects.</p>




<p style="margin-left:40px"><a href="http://hsp.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank"><strong>Haas Scholars Program</strong></a> sponsors the capstone research of twenty high-achieving, low-income students every year, providing recipients with $13,800 stipends. This program is primarily intended for juniors undertaking research over the summer to support work on their honors thesis.</p>




<p style="margin-left:40px"><a href="http://stronach.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank"><strong>Stronach Baccalaureate Prize</strong></a> provides funding up to $25,000 to graduating seniors who will carry out social engagement projects of their own design in the year following graduation. </p>




<p style="margin-left:40px"><a href="http://ucdc.berkeley.edu/uc-washington-program" target="_blank"><strong>UC Washington Program</strong></a> (UCDC) sends approximately 30 juniors and seniors to Washington, D.C. to intern, research, and take classes every fall and spring semester. Cal students from all majors can apply and remain eligible for financial aid. While interning three to four days a week, students live and take classes at the UC Washington Center, in the heart of DC.  During their UCDC semester, students develop professional skills, clarify their future direction, and build important professional networks. </p>




<p style="margin-left:40px"><a href="https://scholarships.berkeley.edu/overview"><strong>Prestigious Scholarships Program</strong></a> administers the application process for several prestigious external scholarships (such as the Rhodes, Marshall, Truman, and Goldwater scholarships). The office provides individualized advising for applicants to these and other nationally competitive scholarships. Please note that the Prestigious Scholarships Program is not associated with the Office of Financial Aid.</p>




<p style="margin-left:40px"><a href="https://uroc.berkeley.edu/"><strong>Underrepresented Researchers of Color</strong></a> (UROC) serves as a pipeline to increase representation of marginalized students in research programs at Cal. Through its community-building initiatives, UROC seeks to increase the visibility, participation, engagement, and presence of students of color in research programs across campus and in research-focused graduate programs. UROC provides important tools and resources to students, including workshops, panels, peer-to-peer and faculty mentoring, as well as less formal opportunities to network with fellow student researchers.</p>




<p>Additionally, the Office of Undergraduate Research promotes undergraduate research by providing the following: </p>




<p style="margin-left:40px"><strong>A campus-wide research database:</strong> OURS maintains a <a href="http://research.berkeley.edu/opportunities">database of research programs</a> within and beyond UC Berkeley. The database is frequently updated with application deadlines and eligibility requirements. </p>




<p style="margin-left:40px"> <strong>Workshops and Peer Advising: </strong>OURS regularly offers workshops and peer-advising services, not only to orient students to the research landscape at UC Berkeley, but also to help students acquire the skills needed to undertake research. Past workshops have been devoted to topics such as &quot;Getting Started,&quot; &quot;Professional Communication,&quot; &quot;Finding a Faculty Mentor,&quot; and &quot;Writing a Research Proposal.&quot; Upcoming workshops are listed on our <a href="https://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/OURS.html">events calendar</a>.  Visit our main website to find out about OURS Peer-Adviser drop-in office hours; speaking with a Peer Adviser is a great way to explore your options.</p>




<p style="margin-left:40px"><strong>OURS Mailing List and Social Media:</strong> Sign up for OURS' popular announcement mailing list on our <a href="http://research.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">homepage</a> and be sure to follow OURS on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OURSUCBerkeley/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/BerkeleyOURS" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. </p>

<h3>Undergraduate Advising</h3>




<p>Major requirements vary among <a href="https://lsadvising.berkeley.edu/majors-minors">major programs</a>. Meet with an L&amp;S undergraduate major adviser (UMA) to help you understand major admission, declaration, and academic planning for a major or minor.</p>




<p>College Advisers are “generalist” advisers in the <a href="https://lsadvising.berkeley.edu/">Office of Undergraduate Advising</a>. They can help you understand campus-wide requirements, such as general education, academic progress, and time to degree. They can also help you identify possible majors.</p>

<h3>Undergraduate and Interdisciplinary Studies</h3>




<p><strong><a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate-studies/undergraduate-interdisciplinary-studies">Undergraduate and Interdisciplinary Studies</a></strong> (UGIS) in the Undergraduate Division of the College of Letters and Science serves as a center for innovations in undergraduate education that extend beyond traditional departmental boundaries. Our major and minor programs attract undergraduates who wish to explore intellectually engaging and promising interdisciplinary fields under the direction of scholars who are pioneers in charting these new areas and methods of inquiry. UGIS has been and continues to be an incubator for new ideas, combining experimental programs and courses with a curriculum designed to promote the ideals of a liberal arts education.</p>

This course will explore the intersection of women's experience and disability issues, emphasizing the social and personal impact of disability and chronic illness on relationships, identity, employment, health, body image, sexuality, reproduction, motherhood, and aging. Through real stories of women's lives which reached the media in the last decade and before, students will move toward a dynamic understanding of the impact of a range of</span><span class="deschide"> physical, emotional, and mental disabilities in the context of current social forces and public policy. We will explore historic perspectives as well as current trends in medicine, independent living, care-giving, insurance, public benefits, law, and community activism as they affect and are affected by disabled women and girls and their families. We will discuss controversial ethical issues such as prenatal screening, wrongful birth law suits, and physician-assisted suicide. Course readings will draw on the rich literature of disabled women's anthologies, biography and autobiograhpy, scholarly and popular literature of disability, feminist analyses, creative writing, women's art, film, and theatre.</span><br/>

World leaders at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held in Copenhagen this past December announced that they reached &quot;a meaningful agreement&quot; that will lead to a global treaty to address climate change.

This course explores museums as dynamic sites of intellectual and cultural debate, and as institutions vested with the authority to define aesthetics, history, heritage, and even citizenship. Now more than ever, as the process of globalization raises questions about the fluidity, preservation, and &quot;authenticity&quot; of culture, museums of all kinds are attracting great interest both as places to visit and as a subject of critical analysis in their</span><span class="deschide"> own right. As places defined by the collection, display, and interpretation of objects, museums are bound up in questions of permanence and transience, difference and identity, equity and privilege--issues that lie at the heart of what is termed the &quot;new museology.&quot; But as institutional repositories of community memory or indigenous knowledge, they are also bound up in questions of representation, access and ownership--issues that move the debate over museum collections squarely into the politics of local, state, and national control over heritage. If ownership and control are the new realities of international heritage policy (and law), museums have quickly emerged as important sites on which and through which these claims are being made.</span><br/>

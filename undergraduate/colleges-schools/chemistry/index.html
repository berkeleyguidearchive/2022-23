<h2>Introduction to the College</h2>




<p>Chemistry, chemical biology, and chemical and biomolecular engineering provide fantastic opportunities for pursuing a stimulating and gratifying career while making a positive impact on society.  Since chemistry is the gateway to all the molecular sciences and much of engineering, the College of Chemistry facilitates many possible career paths. </p>




<p>Humans live in a chemical world where their lives, environment, energy, food, and products are all impacted and/or provided by the activities of chemists and chemical engineers. Making new organic, inorganic, and nano materials; developing new drugs and methods for delivery; developing new synthetic procedures; understanding fundamental elements of chemical structure, bonding, and reactions; exploring chemical biology, the chemical basis of biological processes; producing sustainable energy through biofuels and photovoltaics; and improving the environment through green chemical processes all depend critically upon chemistry and chemical engineering. Students entering these fields today will find exciting careers addressing fundamental challenges in chemistry, applying chemical concepts to problems in related scientific areas, and using established concepts to pioneer new technologies.</p>




<p>The Department of Chemistry and the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering in the College of Chemistry rank among the most prominent in the nation, and both are renowned for their excellence in a diverse range of subdisciplines and applications. Nowhere else will students find such a wide selection of instructional excellence in the chemical sciences and their applications or such varied opportunities for research.  Superb facilities at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory enhance many of the College’s research programs.  The California Institute for Quantitative Biomedical Research (QB3) provides a dynamic interdisciplinary environment in which students and faculty in the college collaborate with their colleagues in the physical and biological sciences and in engineering to conduct cutting-edge research into biological problems and to produce the breakthroughs of the future.</p>




<p>With only two departments, the College of Chemistry provides a relatively small and collegial place in which to live and work while being nestled in one of the most beautiful and vibrant cosmopolitan areas in the world.  Students' intellectual, scientific, and social experiences at Berkeley will shape their lives and outlooks for years to come.</p>

You satisfy the requirement by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, an American Cultures course. You may take an American Cultures course any time during your undergraduate career at Berkeley. The requirement was instituted in 1991 to introduce students to the diverse cultures of the United States through a comparative framework. Courses are offered in more than fifty departments in many different disciplines at both the lower and upper division level.</span></p> <div> </div>

Spring admits who wish to change into the College of Chemistry must speak with <a href="http://chemistry.berkeley.edu/ugrad/current-students/advisers#adv" target="_blank">an Undergraduate Adviser</a> as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Admission to the joint major programs (Chemical Engineering and Materials Science and Chemical Engineering and Nuclear Engineering) is closed to freshmen. Continuing students may petition for a change to a joint major program after their first year.</p>
<h3>Admission as a Freshman</h3>
<p>High school students preparing to major in Chemistry, Chemical Biology, or Chemical Engineering should take the following courses:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Chemistry (one year minimum; two years strongly recommended, including AP Chemistry)</li>
	<li>Physics (one year)</li>
	<li>Mathematics (four years, preferably ending with introductory calculus)</li>
	<li>Foreign language (three years)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Advice for Prospective Freshmen</h3>
<p>Before applying, please take some time to <a href="http://chemistry.berkeley.edu/ugrad/degrees">learn about our majors</a> and make sure that the College of Chemistry is right for you!</p>
<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p><strong>How do I declare my major?</strong></p>
<p>When applying to the College of Chemistry as a Chemistry, Chemical Biology, or Chemical Engineering major, students are officially declaring their major. Students will be expected to enroll in courses that are appropriate for the major starting in the fall semester of their first year.  Students may petition to change into a different major within the College of Chemistry after their first year.</p>
<p><strong>Will I have time to take other courses?</strong></p>
<p>Students have some room in their schedule to explore other subjects and to take breadth electives, but they will be expected to follow the basic program for their major including courses in chemistry, mathematics, and physics.</p>
<p><strong>Can I follow the pre-med path in the College of Chemistry?</strong></p>
<p>Students can prepare for medical, dental, or pharmacy school with a major in the College of Chemistry. Generally, medical schools do not favor any particular undergraduate major. See the <a href="https://career.berkeley.edu/Health/Health.stm" target="_blank">UC Berkeley Career Center web site</a> for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Is the College of Chemistry right for me?</strong></p>
<p>Choosing a major is a big decision. Students who are unsure about what they want to study may prefer to apply to the College of Letters and Science where they will have time to explore several different areas before declaring a major.</p>
<p>However, for students who are ready to commit to a course of study in the chemical sciences, the College of Chemistry is a good choice. With an undergraduate population of 900-1000, the College of Chemistry is a small, collegial college within a large cosmopolitan university. Students have access to a broad array of research facilities and other resources, including an in-house Career Counselor, a robust Peer Tutoring Program, and a strong support staff.</p>

<h3>Admission as a Transfer Student</h3>
<p>The requirements for entry to the University may be met by establishing a good record at another collegiate institution. Transfer applicants must complete at least 60 semester units or 90 quarter units of UC-transferable course work by the end of the spring term before transferring to UC Berkeley. Students are encouraged to investigate the University-preparatory programs offered by the many community colleges throughout California. If admitted as a transfer student, only up to 70 UC-transferable semester units may be transferred from a community college.</p>
<p>Transfer students may apply to the following majors:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Chemistry</li>
	<li>Chemical Biology</li>
	<li>Chemical Engineering</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Chemistry or Chemical Biology </strong></em>applicants must complete, at a minimum, courses equivalent to the following:</p>

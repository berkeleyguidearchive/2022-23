<h3>Guidelines for Reading and Composition Courses</h3>

 

<p>In order to provide a solid foundation in reading, writing and critical thinking for work in the major, the College requires two semesters of lower division work in composition—Reading and Composition (R&amp;C), Parts A and B, in sequential order.</p>

 

<ul> 	<li>All undergraduates must complete the Reading and Composition (R&amp;C) requirement by the end of their fourth semester or their enrollment may be blocked for the following semester.</li> 	<li>All courses used to satisfy Part A or B of Reading and Composition must be completed with a letter grade of C- or better.</li> 	<li>Students who have been admitted to Berkeley and have not completed <a href="/2022-23/undergraduate/colleges-schools/letters-science/entry-level-writing-requirement/">Entry Level Writing</a>, must enroll in College Writing R1A which satisfies both Entry Level Writing and the first half of R&amp;C. Please note: A minimum grade of C is required in COLWRIT R1A in order to satisfy Entry Level Writing. </li> 	<li>AGRS (formerly CLASSIC) R44 (completed with a C- or higher) may be used to satisfy either Part A or Part B of R&amp;C. This course may also be used to satisfy Arts and Literature, Historical Studies, or Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences breadth.</li> 	<li>With the exception of AGRS (formerly CLASSIC) R44, courses fulfilling the Reading and Composition requirement may not be applied to <a href="https://lsadvising.berkeley.edu/seven-course-breadth">Seven-Course Breadth</a>.</li> </ul>

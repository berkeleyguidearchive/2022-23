<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-9276b7bf-7fff-76cc-a9df-375017ffeed5">Launched in 2019, Computing, Data Science, and Society (CDSS) is a transformative new division that brings together faculty and students from across disciplinary boundaries in a collaborative environment of discovery. The Division was created to meet the demands and opportunities of a time when data touches nearly every aspect of our lives. Innovations in computing are converging with extraordinarily large datasets to create unprecedented opportunities to use data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to tackle critical societal issues, from human health to climate change. Drawing on the comprehensive excellence of Berkeley, CDSS works across disciplines to advance the state of the art in computing, data science, information, and statistics, and to found new academic fields to address questions of societal significance. CDSS’ pathbreaking Data Science Undergraduate Studies program, created in partnership with faculty and students from a range of fields, prepares students to use data science ethically and masterfully to engage as informed citizens and leaders. Every semester, hundreds of undergraduates take advantage of teaching, curriculum development, and research opportunities with CDSS. </span></p>

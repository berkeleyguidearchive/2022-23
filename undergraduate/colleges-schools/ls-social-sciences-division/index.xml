The transformational work done by the award-winning faculty and students of these departments has helped to illuminate the tectonic changes in the global economy, climate, technology, and governance of the world which we inhabit today. In addition, the Social Sciences Division faculty and students pursue questions of the long durée, such as &quot;how do we create the good society?&quot; and &quot;how is language acquired&quot;?</span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-b086684d-7fff-ec90-1575-599ccada7b04">The Social Sciences Division is the largest within the university, with 20 percent of the faculty and more than 25 percent of student enrollments. It is also the most diverse, which encourages the offering of a wide range of theoretical approaches and empirical methodologies. These allow for a much better understanding of the ways in which human beings, past and present, have organized their lives. This diversity offers both scholars and students an unparalleled opportunity to range far and wide in their search for solutions to individual, social, and global problems.</span></p>

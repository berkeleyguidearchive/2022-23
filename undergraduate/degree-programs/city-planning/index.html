				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Minor</h3>
<p><span>The City Planning minor provides students with the knowledge of how cities function, how urban processes might be researched, and how urban environments can be transformed through planning, policy, design, and social action. While the minor cannot convey the full scope of city planning, various combinations of courses in the minor program can, we feel, augment a major program with a particular slant or emphasis on planning issues or processes.</span></p>
<h3>Declaring the Minor</h3>
<p><span style="font-size:1em">To declare, students must submit the </span><a href="https://ced.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-advising/forms-documents/" style="font-size: 1em;" target="_blank">CED Minor Declaration Form</a><span style="font-size:1em">, available on the CED website. </span><span style="font-size:1em">Once this request has been approved, you will see the minor added to your Cal Central student profile. It is your responsibility to track your progress towards minor completion using the Academic Progress Report and CED Advising Services. </span></p>
<p>DEADLINE TO SUBMIT FORM: One semester prior to a students final semester. </p>

Over half of the world's population is now urban. As urban populations swell, metropolitan areas in both the developed and the developing world struggle to provide basic services and address the negative externalities associated with rapid growth. Sanitation, transportation, pollution, energy services, and public safety typically fall to sub-national governments. Yet local sub-national institutions face difficulties as they tackle these challenges because</span><span class="deschide"> development tends to spill over political boundaries and resources are limited. Such difficulties are particularly acute in the developing world due to tighter resource constraints, weak institutions, and the comparative severity of the underlying problems. Moreover, democratization and decentralization suggest that urban governance and service delivery may have become more democratic, but present challenges with respect to priority setting, coordination, and corruption.</span><br/>

Community development, broadly defined as efforts to improve the quality of life in low-income communities, has existed in multiple forms for centuries.

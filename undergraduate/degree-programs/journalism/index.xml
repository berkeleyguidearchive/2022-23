<![CDATA[
<p>The Journalism Minor at UC Berkeley gives students hands-on training to modernize their skills across a wide range of media platforms. Classes are offered on a range of topics that include narrative writing, web skills, social media, photography, video, and audio reporting.</p>
<p>No matter your major or intended profession, literacy today requires the ability to communicate with text, pictures, video, and sound. In these courses, you will learn how to shape information into compelling, well-reported narratives. Instruction will focus on teaching students to use the latest digital tools to engage with audiences in their work and to think critically and responsibly about information.</p>
<p>The minor degree is open to all Berkeley students. For visitors—including students from abroad, other UC campuses, or from other universities—a certificate option is available. Courses are also open to students who are neither seeking the minor or a certificate, and just want to learn a new skill or gain a better understanding of journalistic media forms.</p>
<p>The Journalism Minor is housed in the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism, which is widely regarded as one of the top professional journalism programs in the United States. Its teaching faculty is composed of distinguished current and former professional journalists who bring real-world expertise to the classroom. The Master of Journalism program was launched in 1951 and established as a professional school at UC Berkeley in 1968.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Minor</h3>
<p>Students intending to complete the journalism minor degree should fill out a Declaration of Intent form (available on the program home page) and submit it to the Berkeley Journalism Student Services department no later than the start of their final course.</p>
<p>Students with a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but are not noted on diplomas.</p>

<p>The Journalism minor requires completion of five courses. </p>

As the costs of our industrialized food system become impossible to ignore, a national debate over the future of food and farming has begun. Telling stories about where food comes from, how it is produced (and might be produced differently) plays a critical role in bringing attention to the issues and shifting politics. Each week a prominent figure in this debate explores what can be done to make the food system healthier more equitable, more sustainable, and the role</span><span class="deschide"> of storytelling in the process.</span><br/>

What’s it like to tell stories using a variety of different media? Competence in the use of new journalistic tools and the skill to shape content for rapidly changing formats are both essential for any communicator in the 21st century. This intensive introductory course is designed to teach foundational skills for students who have minimal or no experience in creating multimedia news packages. Using</span><span class="deschide"> lectures, readings, discussions, guest speakers, and field work, we will guide students through an exploration of the elements and forms of multimedia storytelling, and teach skills in news gathering and story production. This course is part of minor program which has been approved for fall &amp; spring.</span><br/>

Using case studies, instructors will teach how to – and how not to -- create, organize and manage multimedia news packages. Students will learn how to choose which medium — video, audio, still photography, graphics or text — best suits the particular type of story or different segments of a story they wish to tell. By the conclusion of the course students will have developed basic skills in choosing stories, shooting video and still images with a mobile device, writing accompanying text, and editing their work by laptop into finished story packages. Importantly, students will also learn how to apply core journalistic values and the highest professional standards to their multimedia work. A required final project presents students the opportunity to apply their learning.</p></div>

This course introduces students to the workflows and techniques for journalistic reporting using data. In many traditional forms of journalism, reporters rely mostly on interviews and anecdotes to create stories. But in a world filled with misinformation—where the very foundations of trust have been shaken—audiences expect more. This course will cover using data for both research</span><span class="deschide"> and reporting, as well as communicating stories with data. Data has become ubiquitous and accessible in recent years. Data analysis skills are now part of the standard repertoire for many journalists. By its nature, data is based on evidence and observations. But like all evidence, it needs context and interpretation.<br/>

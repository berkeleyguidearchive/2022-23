				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript, but are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the term before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the program advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process. This information is also on the <a href="https://creative.berkeley.edu/">Creative Writing Minor website</a>. See <a href="https://creative.berkeley.edu/declaring-and-completing-2/">Declaring and Completing</a>.</li>
	<li>Five upper division courses are required, consisting of three approved courses in creative writing and two approved courses in literature.</li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be taken for graded credit (a letter grade).</li>
	<li>A minimum of three of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley. </li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement for Letters &amp; Science students.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division minor course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for one major program.</li>
	<li><span>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which you plan to graduate. If you cannot finish all courses required for the minor by that time, please see a College of Letters &amp; Science adviser.</span></li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed within the unit ceiling. (For further information regarding the unit ceiling, please see the College Requirements tab.)</li>

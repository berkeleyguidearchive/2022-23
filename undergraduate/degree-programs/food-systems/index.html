				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p>The food systems minor, hosted by the Department of Environmental Science, Policy &amp; Management (ESPM) in the Rausser College of Natural Resources, is an interdisciplinary program of study that explores the role of food within the environment and society. Drawing from diverse fields as far-ranging as ecology, sociology, the humanities, nutrition, history, and economics, the food systems minor critically examines issues of contemporary food and agriculture from a whole-systems perspective.</p>
<p>Students take five courses, one of which can be lower division and one of which can overlap with their major. A required community engagement project during the junior or senior spring allows students to bring together what they have learned in a real-world setting.</p>
<p>Students who complete the minor will gain a broad and interdisciplinary understanding of critical themes and concepts related to the social, political, economic, environmental, cultural, nutritional, and public health issues of contemporary food and agriculture systems both domestically and internationally.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/minors/food-systems" target="_blank">Visit  Program Website</a></p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><h4 class="introtext"><span>General Guidelines</span></h4>
<p>Courses must be taken for a letter grade unless the course is only offered on a <em>Pass/No Pass</em> basis. The student must achieve at least a C (2.0) average in the courses taken in satisfaction of a minor program. Students may take one lower division course to count toward the major requirements and may overlap one course, lower or upper division, with their major requirements. The five courses taken for the major, two core courses, two elective courses, and the experiential learning course must total at least 15 units.</p>
<p>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the minor advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process. </p>
<p>The requirements of the minor include:</p>

<h4>3. Community Engagement Project</h4>
<p>Students will complete three (3) units of experiential learning through ESPM 197, consisting of two hours/week of in-class time with approximately 7 hours per week spent on-the-ground with a partner organization. <strong>This course is only offered in spring terms and should be scheduled in the students' final spring semester. </strong></p>
<p style="margin-left:5.5pt"><strong>Experiential Learning through Engagement in Food Systems </strong></p>
<p style="margin-left:5.5pt">Central to the goal of the minor is an experiential learning internship, to be taken during the student’s junior or senior year. During an entire semester (or longer if they choose), students will work with an organization focused on some aspect of food system change. Students will work with the Community Engagement Faculty Coordinator to identify a community engagement partner organization that fits best with the student's interest. Students will receive credit for community engagement through enrollment in ESPM 197. </p>

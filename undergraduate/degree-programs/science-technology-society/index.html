				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p>As our students enter into a world of accelerating change, it has become ever more important that these future scientists, engineers, computer and data scientists, health care practitioners, social scientists, teachers, policymakers, and more be able to reason about the social and ethical implications of science and technology in their fields and in public life. The Undergraduate Minor in Science, Technology and Society (STS) brings Berkeley undergraduates to the forefront of understanding the global impact of science, technology and medicine-related challenges. </p>
<p>The STS Minor provides students critical thinking skills to effectively contribute to a world shaped by computing and artificial intelligence, environmental change, new medical technologies, and genetic engineering. Students engage with current technoscientific issues in historical context, develop capacities to examine scientific and technical processes, and practice speaking about them effectively to multidisciplinary audiences.</p>
<h4>Declaring the Minor</h4>
<p><span>To declare the minor:</span></p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Complete the core course </strong>with a C (2.0) or better. In Spring 2022, the core course is <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTORY%20182A" title="HISTORY 182A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTORY 182A');">HISTORY 182A</a></span>. After Spring 2022, the core course is <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=STS%20C100" title="STS C100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'STS C100');">STS C100</a></span>.</li>
	<li><strong>Complete the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeRESHsqR25fmZ0rOC4jldtVJtVGfYFenFfgEcnuiu740ScFw/viewform" target="_blank">STS Minor Application</a></strong>, listing your proposed (or any already-taken) elective courses, to declare the minor by the deadline listed above.</li>
</ol>
<p>The STS Minor advisor will notify the student whether their proposal satisfies the requirements for the minor, and will advise the student on their proposed self-designed pathway, if applicable.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="https://cstms.berkeley.edu/teaching-undergraduate-minor-in-sts/" target="_blank">Visit Program Website</a></p>
			</div>
			<div id="minorrequirementstextcontainer" class="page_content tab_content" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="minorrequirementstexttab" >
				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><h3>To complete the STS minor:</h3>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Complete four upper-division electives</strong> toward the minor. See below for suggested paths through the minor and elective options.</li>
	<li><strong>Petition (FORTHCOMING)</strong> to have STS any elective courses not currently on the approved list (if any) included in your minor. These must be upper-division or graduate-level courses.</li>
	<li><strong>Complete the STS Minor Application</strong> (FORTHCOMING) with all upper-division elective terms and grades entered to complete the minor by the deadline listed above.</li>
	<li><strong>NOTE: If you will be completing courses toward the minor during your graduating semester, </strong>please email <a href="mailto:cstms@berkeley.edu">cstms@berkeley.edu</a> to let us know by the deadline listed above. Then, complete the STS Minor Application form as soon as your grades are posted and email <a href="mailto:cstms@berkeley.edu">cstms@berkeley.edu</a> again.</li>
	<li>Complete the <a href="https://lsadvising.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/minorcompletion_fillable.pdf">general minor petition in L&amp;S or your home college</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Program Requirements and Recommendations</h3>
<p>Students must take one required upper-division core course and four upper-division elective courses that relate to Science, Technology, and Society and are taught by affiliated faculty.</p>
<p>Students have the option to choose one of four pathways through the Minor, selecting their four electives from among the approved courses in that pathway, or to design their own pathway in consultation with the Minor Advisor. Each elective may be no fewer than 3 units. See below for a list of approved upper-division elective courses.</p>
<p>A lower-division gateway course of <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTORY%2030" title="HISTORY 30" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTORY 30');">HISTORY 30</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=DATA%204AC" title="DATA 4AC" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'DATA 4AC');">DATA 4AC</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ANTHRO%2084" title="ANTHRO 84" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ANTHRO 84');">ANTHRO 84</a></span>, and/or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ISF%2060" title="ISF 60" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ISF 60');">ISF 60</a></span> for the minor is recommended but not required. These courses serve as channels to the Minor, familiarizing students with fundamental STS topics and setting them up to succeed in the Minor.<br/>
 </p>
<h3>Pathways through the STS Minor</h3>
<p>Students may follow one of four recommended pathways through the Minor, detailed below, or propose their own pathway in consultation with the STS Minor Advisor when declaring the Minor. These pathways draw on approved course offerings curated by the Center for Science, Technology, Medicine and Society and offer guidance on how the STS Minor complements popular majors on campus including computer science, data science, molecular and cell biology, sociology, history, environmental studies, and more. They have been developed in consultation with the STS faculty across UC Berkeley. They are:</p>
<ol>
	<li>History and Philosophy of Science</li>
	<li>Medicine, the Body, and Society</li>
	<li>Environmental Change and Society</li>
	<li>The Human Contexts of Data and Computing</li>
</ol>
<p>A list of courses for each pathway is provided below.<br/>
 </p>
<h3>Course Policies Regarding the STS Minor</h3>
<p>One of the four elective courses that counts toward the minor can be taken outside UC Berkeley (pending the approval of the undergraduate minor advisor); the rest must be taken at UC Berkeley and cannot be transferred from other institutions. The core course must be taken at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>Students must take all five minor courses for a letter grade, and maintain an average of 2.0 in those courses, to fulfill the minor. There is no overall minimum GPA requirement to declaring or completing the minor.</p>
<p>Students may use a single course from a single major to satisfy a minor requirement. The overlapping course must not exceed four units.<br/>
 </p>
<h3>Upper-Division Elective Courses for the STS Minor</h3>
<p>Following is a list of courses in each of the predefined pathways of the STS Minor, as well as a full list of STS-related courses that can be used as electives for the Minor if a student chooses to build their own pathway.</p>
<p>Upper-division and graduate-level STS-related courses not currently on the list of approved electives can be approved by petition to the STS Minor advisor. Students must submit the syllabus of the course with their petition. Eligible courses must be at least three units and be taken for a letter grade.</p>
<h4>Courses for the STS Minor Pathways</h4>
<p>Students who choose one of the pathways through the STS Minor will choose from the following courses to complete the Minor:</p>
<h5>1. THE HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE</h5>

This course provides an overview of the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and apply them to a wide range of topics, including geography, history, environmental</span><span class="deschide"> and information science, and others. Questions this course will address include: how are scientific facts constructed? How are values embedded in technical systems?<br/></span><br/>

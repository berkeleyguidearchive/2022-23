				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Minor</h3>
<p>The undergraduate minor in environmental design and urbanism in developing countries serves students majoring in humanities, social sciences, and a variety of professional fields. The minor is intended to expose students to basic problems, cultural contexts, policy alternatives, and design solutions in the Third World.</p>
<p>There is no major program; students interested in pursuing this course of study at the major level should consider the <a href="/2022-23/undergraduate/degree-programs/architecture/" target="_blank">BA in Architecture program</a>.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Minor</h3>
<p>A letter grade of C- or higher is required in ENV DES 1 to declare the minor. To declare, students must submit the <a href="https://ced.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-advising/forms-documents/" target="_blank">CED Minor Declaration Form</a>, available on the CED website. Once this request has been approved, you will see the minor added to your Cal Central student profile. It is your responsibility to track your progress towards minor completion using the Academic Progress Report and CED Advising Services. </p>

This course will teach anyone how to start to be a designer, not just of drawings and objects, but also buildings, landscapes, and urban spaces. And not just in isolation, but in the complex web of ecological and man-made systems which makes up our shifting environment. You will take from the course first-hand experience of drawing, measuring, and design — which form the basis of the professions of architecture, landscape architecture</span><span class="deschide">, and urban planning— and which culminate in a final design project in the course. The course is open to all undergraduate students.</span><br/>

The Summer [IN]STITUTE consists of four cohorts, each an introductory course for participants with no previous experience in environmental design: [IN]ARCH, [IN]ARCH ADV, [IN]CITY and [IN]LAND. Institute participants explore the methods and theories of the environmental design disciplines, experience the culture of design and planning studios, connect to faculty and practitioners</span><span class="deschide">, and build a portfolio for graduate school application. Each program includes a lecture series, a design or planning studio, a media seminar, and site visits.

This study of cities is more important than ever; for the first time in history more people live in urban than rural areas, and cities will account for all of the world's population growth for at least the next half-century. We will explore the challenges facing global cities in the 21st Century and expose students to some of the key texts, theories, and methods of inquiry that shape the built environment, from the human scale of home and</span><span class="deschide"> community to the regional scale of the megacity.</span><br/>

This course explores cities and landscapes as layered repositories of history, both ecological and human. Examining environmental design history and practice, it highlights how deep time legacies are acknowledged or ignored in placemaking, including racialized spatial histories. In addressing the role of architecture, city planning, and landscape design in shaping places and giving them meaning, the course explores the diversity of spatially defined experiences</span><span class="deschide"> and the ways in which they are shaped by policy and professional practice. Case studies on Bay Area urban and social geography are linked with transnational histories and design movements to highlight the larger forces that have shaped the local historical and social landscape.</span><br/>

Weekly assignments include</span><span class="deschide"> prose readings, generally essays related to life experience. Brief readings and discussions during each class, along with weekly writing assignments of 3-5 pages of prose will illustrate the skills involved in the craft of writing.</span><br/>

This course explores relationships between data, design and activism, raising critical questions about what data and data analytics are; what design is; and how both data and design can serve to protect the status quo as well as become agents of change. In turn, the course also surveys the ways in which activism has historically played a role in data analysis and design practice at the scales of planning, architecture, landscape, and cities.<br/>
Through lectures</span><span class="deschide">, readings, and exercises, students explore data/design activism or the use of data analytics and design interventions to catalyze change.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Media Studies major integrates perspectives from liberal arts, social sciences, and humanities and offers an interdisciplinary framework to understand the essential role that media plays in economic, social, political, and cultural life. It weds traditions from communication, history, anthropology, sociology, and political science with critical theories and cultural studies to analyze the role and meaning of media in our societies. Our emphasis in this major is historical and theoretical, examining media systems, institutions, technologies, policies, and practices. We offer students the analytical tools available to investigate media—old and new, local and global—from textual to visual and digital cultures, and from TV to Film and social media. The Media Studies major offers three areas of concentration: Digital Studies, Global Cultural Studies, or Media Law and Policy.</span></p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Students planning to declare a major in Media Studies are advised to read the Media Studies website in its entirety and then contact a student academic adviser as early as possible to discuss their academic program plans. Visit <a href="http://mediastudies.ugis.berkeley.edu/">the program's website</a> for application instructions and deadlines.</p>
<p>Students who wish to declare the major in Media Studies:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Must have completed at least 30 units of college coursework before applying to the program.</li>
	<li>Must have completed at least three of the major prerequisites, including <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MEDIAST%2010" title="MEDIAST 10" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MEDIAST 10');">MEDIAST 10</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MEDIAST%20W10" title="MEDIAST W10" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MEDIAST W10');">MEDIAST W10</a></span>.</li>
	<li>Must be currently enrolled in any remaining prerequisites at the time of application (see the list of approved major prerequisites on the Major Requirements tab).</li>
	<li>Must have a minimum grade point average (GPA) of 3.2 in courses relevant to the major. This includes the lower division prerequisite courses and the equivalency of transferred coursework as well as any lower or upper division courses already completed for the major.</li>

(Beginning fall 2020, Media Studies 10 or W10 must be taken at UC Berkeley.)</li>

Junior transfers should declare the major no later than their second semester at Berkeley and should contact a Media Studies student academic adviser concerning their eligibility and the equivalency of transferred coursework.</li>
	<li>When applying to the major, students will need to note their area of concentration–Digital Studies, Global Cultural Studies, or Media Law &amp; Policy–on their application. See the Major Requirements tab for areas of concentration information.</li>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Media Studies major at the University of California, Berkeley is an undergraduate interdisciplinary group major in the Office of Undergraduate and Interdisciplinary Studies (UGIS). We offer students the analytical tools available to examine media—old and new, local, regional and global—including media consumption and meaning-making processes. Courses taught by core faculty in Media Studies cover media history and theory, emphasizing media systems, institutions, policies, and practices. Additionally, faculty from many departments across campus bring the perspectives and methods of their fields to bear on media analysis in a variety of elective courses.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><br/>
<span>Our four core courses examine media history, theory, institutions/policy, and globalization. In addition to these, students must complete five electives. Three will be in service of one of our areas of concentration: Digital Studies, Global Cultural Studies, or Media Law and Policy. Students are free to take the remaining two electives from any area of concentration. Core courses and electives offered by the Media Studies program—whether examining popular culture and entertainment, advertising, or news and information viewed on cinema, television, computer, or mobile phone screens—ask students to develop critical thinking and analytical skills. </span></p>

In this course, students learn why sound journalism is so important to a healthy, working democracy. Journalism is rapidly changing. The class will give a context to those changes and provide an overview of comtemporary journalistic institutions. Students will examine how news is made, who decides what news is, who makes it, who profits by it, and what rules guide how reporters and editors work. Central issues affecting journalism, such as bias and professionalism</span><span class="deschide">, will be discussed. The class is not specifically intended for future journalists, but students will learn why pursuing a career in journalism can be so fulfilling and thrilling, as well as becoming better consumers of the news.</span><br/>

The history of journalism is a broad subject--far broader than can comprehensively be covered in a single course. So necessarily, this course takes an idiosyncratic approach. This course examines how news has been defined, discovered, and communicated from its early modern origins to the present. It will also focus on particular areas of journalism. The class will take a critical look at how wars get reported on, including the current war in</span><span class="deschide"> Iraq. The class will examine the role of journalists in the rise of the Cold War more than half a century ago. It will also examine the importance of media barons, by studying two highly readable biographies, one of William Randolph Hearst, the other of Katherine Graham. And finally, the class will look at the role journalists played in unseating President Nixon.</span><br/>

This course will examine the history of online news beginning with the earliest experiments with news delivered via dedicated terminals. From there, we’ll look at the impact of the personal computer’s growth and the rise of proprietary dial-up online services.

We’ll focus on key figures in technology and journalism who shaped the new medium, and trace how its growth undermined traditional economic models even as it enabled the rise of new ones, continuing through today’s world of mobile apps, aggregators and social media.</span><br/>

This course will familiarize you with the often-contentious history of media theory. At issue among scholars working within different theoretical and research traditions are core disagreements about what should be studied (institutions, texts, audiences, and/or technologies) and how media should be studied (for applied, “practical” purposes or with an eye that is critical of power and institutional structures). Course readings and lectures stress</span><span class="deschide"> an understanding of these various research traditions by focusing on the cultural, historical, political, and social contexts surrounding them, the research models and methods used, and the findings and conclusions reached.</span><br/>

This class uses the approaches of media studies and cultural studies to critically consider how historical and emerging new media technologies—as well as the behaviors and forms of cultural production associated with them—influence and are themselves influenced by our everyday practices and lived experiences. It focuses particularly on concerns of identity, community, access, citizenship, industry, and regulation as these relate to social</span><span class="deschide"> networking, collective endeavor, and public speech.</span><br/>

How have the realities and representations of digital media affected how we think, feel, and interact? What impulses, events, and personalities gave rise to the relentless digitization of information, choice, and even life itself? In this interdisciplinary course, we will attempt to answers these questions together by reading, discussing, and writing about histories and theories of cybernetics and cybercultures. We will consider competing cybernetic models</span><span class="deschide"> of the mind, human behavior, ecological environments, and complex immersive virtual worlds. We will also survey the vast range of visionary, skeptical, and delightfully eccentric responses to the promises and perils of a cybernetic future.</span><br/>

This course takes a Postcolonial Feminist Cultural Studies approach to examine the changing meanings of gender, race and national identity in popular cultures across the globe.

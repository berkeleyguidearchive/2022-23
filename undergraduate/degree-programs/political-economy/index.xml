<h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Political Economy major is designed to study the relationship between government, society, and the economy in a holistic manner from a multi-disciplinary perspective. Political Economy majors investigate how real-world market systems are embedded in both politics and society. They graduate with a mastery of a broad range of contemporary analyses as well as a deep understanding of classic works of political economy.</p>
<p>The study of Political Economy is both scientific, with its rigorous attention to social science methodology, and normative, with its concern for the big questions of how best to organize politics, society, and the economy. Political Economy seeks to examine the role of the state in the economy and to assess which government policies and market institutions can move us toward a better society.</p>
<p>The major focuses on contemporary problems while building on a strong historical foundation. Students can choose to study such topics as economic development, trade and investment, global inequality, climate change, resource distribution, gender relations, financial systems, information technology, or health policy.</p>
<p>Some of the issues addressed in the major and its courses include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="menu-item menu-item-type-custom menu-item-object-custom menu-item-4593">How rising consumer demand impedes efforts to combat climate change;</li>
	<li class="menu-item menu-item-type-custom menu-item-object-custom menu-item-4593">How different national or subnational varieties of capitalism serve diverse priorities;</li>
	<li class="menu-item menu-item-type-custom menu-item-object-custom menu-item-4593">How public and private sector institutions affect economic performance.</li>
	<li class="menu-item menu-item-type-custom menu-item-object-custom menu-item-4593">How democratic and authoritarian political systems operate differently;</li>
	<li class="menu-item menu-item-type-custom menu-item-object-custom menu-item-4593">How interdependence may undermine the efforts of national governments to cope with urgent national issues such as unemployment, inflation, health, and housing;</li>
	<li class="menu-item menu-item-type-custom menu-item-object-custom menu-item-4593">How social, political and economic factors combine to exacerbate economic inequality both within and across countries; and</li>
	<li class="menu-item menu-item-type-custom menu-item-object-custom menu-item-4593">How political interests can impede the pursuit of public purpose both domestically and internationally.</li>
</ul>

</ol>
<h3><span>Honors Program</span></h3>
<p>To graduate with honors from the group major in PE, students must enroll in the two-semester honors seminar, <span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="GLOBAL H102">GLOBAL H102</span></span> (fall only) and <span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="POLECON H195">POLECON H195</span></span> (spring only) and must obtain a grade point average (GPA) of 3.6 in the major and 3.5 in overall University coursework. The honors seminar (<span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="POLECON H195">POLECON H195</span></span>) is taken in addition to a student's regular course work for fulfilling requirements for the major and culminates in the writing of a senior thesis. To qualify for <span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="POLECON H195">POLECON H195</span></span>, students must be recommended by the <span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="GLOBAL H102">GLOBAL H102</span></span> instructor. The thesis is read by the <span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="POLECON H195">POLECON H195</span></span> instructor and at least one other faculty member who is selected by the student in consultation with the thesis instructor. Please consult a program advisor about honors eligibility.</p>
<p>There is no guarantee that students accepted into the honors program will graduate with honors. Honors recommendations are made after graduation and are based on a number of factors including (but not limited to) major GPA, grades received for <span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="GLOBAL H102">GLOBAL H102</span></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="POLECON H195">POLECON H195</span></span>, and faculty adviser recommendations.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>Political Economy (PE) offers a five-course minor that is open to all undergraduates except<em> </em>PE majors. In addition to the <span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="POLECON 100">POLECON 100</span></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="POLECON 101">POLECON 101</span></span> courses, students must chose a concentration topic and take three courses aligned with that topic. A list of pre-approved concentration courses and the application to declare the minor can be found on the <a href="https://politicaleconomy.berkeley.edu/courses-of-study/minor-program/" target="_blank">Political Economy Minor Webpage</a>. Students must declare the minor at least one semester before their expected graduation term. Students must email the completed and signed <a href="https://lsadvising.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/minorcompletion_fillable.pdf" target="_blank">Completion of L&amp;S Minor Form</a> to the PE minor advisor in their final semester of undergraduate work.</p>

<p>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, listed on the College Requirements tab, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</p>
<h3><span>Repeat Rule</span></h3>
<p>Students who earn a grade of F, D-, D, D+, or NP may repeat the course only once. Regardless of the grade, the student receives for their second attempt (including F, D-, D, or D+), the student may <strong>not</strong> repeat the course a third time.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the major requirements below must be taken for a letter grade. (The only exceptions to this rule are language courses. All language classes, including the fourth semester, may be taken for a letter grade or Pass/No Pass.)</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used simultaneously to fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs, with the exception of minors offered outside of the College of Letters &amp; Science.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be maintained in both upper and lower division courses used to fulfill the major requirements.</li>
</ol>
<h5>GPA REQUIREMENT FOR DECLARING THE PE MAJOR </h5>
<p>The P/NP policy noted above does not affect the 2.7 GPA requirement to declare the PE major. The GPA will be calculated based on those courses taken for a grade.</p>

<h3>Foreign Language Requirement</h3>
<p>Political Economy (PE) majors must demonstrate proficiency in a modern language other than English by the last semester of their senior year. Proficiency is equivalent to the ability achieved in four college-level semesters (or two years). Language courses taken in high school do not satisfy this requirement. See below for details on how to fulfill the foreign language requirement.</p>
<p>Languages accepted by the College of Letters &amp; Science are not automatically accepted by the Political Economy program. Please check with a PE adviser for eligible languages.</p>
<p>There are a variety of ways to fulfill the four-semester language requirement for PE depending on the individual and his or her background and ability.</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) test:</strong> An AP score of 5 or an International Baccalaureate (IB) score of 7 will complete this requirement. An AP score of 4 will place a student into the fourth-semester college-level course. A score of 3 will place a student into the third-semester college-level course. Documentation of AP scores must be provided.</li>
	<li><strong>Coursework: </strong>Any combination of college courses, summer programs, or college-level study abroad programs may satisfy the language requirement. Language classes are the only classes used to fulfill major requirements that may be taken for a letter grade or Pass/No Pass.  This includes the fourth semester. Language courses need not be taken at Berkeley. Courses taken at a community college or any accredited school or university may be acceptable. A one-semester upper division course taken abroad in the target language may satisfy the foreign language requirement, depending on the school and program followed. For more information, see a PE adviser concerning language study abroad.</li>
	<li><strong>Proficiency exam</strong>: Some, but not all, language departments on campus offer proficiency testing for students with advanced skills in that language. Please note that if a particular language is not taught on the UC Berkeley campus, then students are not able to test in that language. A student would then need to choose one of the other methods for fulfilling the foreign language requirement. Please speak with a PE adviser about proficiency testing.</li>
	<li><strong>High school completion in a non-English language</strong>: Students who were educated in a non-English language through the completion of high school or the equivalent may wish to satisfy this requirement with that experience. This requires a language proficiency exam. </li>
</ol>

<h3><span>Concentration</span></h3>
<p>The concentration is made up of four courses. Within the concentration, only two courses may be taken from the same department. Up to three courses taken abroad may count, provided they conform to the concentration topic; a syllabus in English must be provided.</p>
<p>The PE concentration is the theoretical focal point in the major. It is meant to give students the opportunity to deepen their understanding of political economy around an area of particular interest to them. The concentration is perhaps the greatest benefit of the Political Economy major because it allows students to apply the theoretical and methodological knowledge they have gained to a topic about which they feel particularly drawn or curious. Students spend four courses focusing on this material, so it is important for students to be thoughtful and develop a topic about which they enjoy learning.</p>
<p>To get started on the concentration, students should think about an existing or potential issue or question in political economy. Then they should choose four courses that will inform or increase their understanding about that issue. These courses should all relate to the topic as well as to one another. Students are encouraged to be imaginative in defining a concentration. A concentration issue is formulated by the student with the assistance of a PE advisor who can help to explain, clarify, or perhaps challenge that issue. Students having a difficult time formulating a concentration should think about the classes they have taken which they enjoyed the most and consider what topics they learned about in those courses. Also, topics covered in <span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="GLOBAL 45">GLOBAL 45</span></span> (GLOBAL N45), <span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="POLECON 100">POLECON 100</span></span>, and <span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="POLECON 101">POLECON 101</span></span> are a good place to start.</p>
<p>Some sample concentration topics include, but most certainly are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Public Policy and Socioeconomic Inequality in the US</li>
	<li>Political Economy of China</li>
	<li>Environmental Policy in Post-Industrial Societies</li>
	<li>Resource Distribution and Development</li>
</ul>
<p>Departments and disciplines to consider when searching for concentration courses: Global Studies; Political Economy; Political Science; Economics; Sociology; Geography; History; Public Policy; Environmental Economics and Policy; Public Health; Gender and Women's Studies; Legal Studies; Environmental Science, Policy, and Management; and City and Regional Planning. Courses from these departments and disciplines are not guaranteed approval for a concentration, nor are students limited to the above list; this is just a good starting point. For a list of Pre-designed Political Economy concentrations, please visit the <a href="https://politicaleconomy.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Political Economy website</a><a href="http://live-international-area-studies-academic-program.pantheon.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Political-Economy-Pre-designed-Concentrations-ES-9.11.17.pdf">.</a></p>
<p>To discuss the concentration topic, students must schedule an appointment with a PE advisor. At the meeting, the student must provide a brief explanation about how each course relates to the proposed concentration topic. Students may be asked to provide syllabi for certain courses.</p>
<p><span>Any subsequent changes to already approved concentration topics and/or courses must be submitted to a PE advisor for approval by the Political Economy Faculty Committee prior to the concentration being changed.</span></p>

The 21st century has seen powerful critiques of both growing economic inequality and the troubling persistence of domination based on gender, race and other categorical differences. Gender has a distinctive role here for many reasons: the centrality of gender to social reproduction; the historical coproduction of male domination and capitalism; and the way gender operates in the constitution of selves. Insofar as capitalism is organized and</span><span class="deschide"> distributes power and profits through gendered structures, and gendered meanings and identities are shaped by their emergence within capitalist logics, it behooves us to think gender and capitalism in tandem.

This course investigates the historical origins and institutional ecosystem of Silicon Valley by identifying key factors in the development of Silicon Valley, as well as political circumstances and cultural conditions that have sustained its important role in the global economy. Questions like these will be addressed: Will Silicon Valley and artificial intelligence render workers irrelevant? Have the region’s tech giants like Google, Apple and</span><span class="deschide"> Facebook become the monopolists of the new Gilded Age, and should they be broken up? Has Silicon Valley peaked? Is the “Silicon Valley model” unique or can it be replicated elsewhere? Lectures are discussion-driven, interactive, and will be complemented by films, debate, and group work.</span><br/>

This course examines the history, theory, and operation of the American financial system. Key questions we will consider include: What is money? What is finance? How did the financial system evolve historically in the American context? To answer these questions, we will first look to histories and then canonical theorizations before turning to the operation of money and the nuts-and-bolts of American financial markets. Finally, we examine the global financial</span><span class="deschide"> crisis of 2008 and its aftermath in light of these considerations. The goal of this course is for students to develop a basic understanding of the historical development, theoretical underpinnings, and actual practice of the American financial system.</span><br/>

How can we understand the role of digital technology in our lives and in society today? In this course we will investigate the political economy of digital technologies. In doing so, we will consider how the rapid rise of digital technologies is simultaneously reinforcing past structures of power while also forging new terrains of contestation. Throughout this process, we will consider how injustice is exacerbated or justice is achieved through the proliferation of</span><span class="deschide"> these new technologies. Finally, we will examine the creative forms of resistance that have emerged alongside these technologies.</span><br/>

<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the <a href="https://english.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/the_minor">declaration process</a>.</li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li><span style="font-size:1em">A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</span></li>
	<li>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement, for Letters &amp; Science students.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which you plan to graduate. If you cannot finish all courses required for the minor by that time, please see a College of Letters &amp; Science adviser.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed within the unit ceiling. (For further information regarding the unit ceiling, please see the College Requirements tab.)</li>

<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-921eb48b-58a4-40de-fda9-b38a24dab9fd">For students considering graduating in less than four years, it's important to acknowledge the reasons to undertake such a plan of study. While there are advantages to pursuing a three-year degree plan such as reducing financial burdens, they are not for everyone and do involve sacrifices; especially with respect to participating in co-curricular activities, depth of study,  and summer internships, which typically lead to jobs upon graduation. All things considered, please see the tables for three and three and a half year degree options.</span></p>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The study of literature is not about canonical books or established facts, but about a process of interpretation and analysis, a process that begins in the classroom and develops over a lifetime. Upon completion of a BA degree in English, students should have well-developed writing and research skills as well as the ability to assess and appreciate language and literature in both professional and personal realms.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Identify historical periods of literature in English ( US, Britain, and Anglophone).</li>
	<li>Recognize and understand a variety of genres and modes of writing (the novel, poetic forms, short fiction, autobiography, etc.).</li>
	<li>Become conversant with key literary terms and theories.</li>
	<li>Develop an understanding of literature in interdisciplinary and multicultural contexts.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Demonstrate the ability to give a close reading or explication of a text.</li>
	<li>Develop the ability to interpret and analyze literary texts and to articulate that in both writing and speaking.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate an understanding of the philosophical, cultural, social, and historical influences on the creation of literary art.</li>
	<li>Formulate a well-organized, well-supported argument.</li>
	<li>Develop research skills in the library and online.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate the ability to write clear critical essays, based on close reading of primary texts and secondary sources.</li>
	<li>Observe ethical and precise citation practices.</li>
	<li>For some, write well in creative modes: fiction, non-fiction, poetry.</li>

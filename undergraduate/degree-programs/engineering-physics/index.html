				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The engineering physics major offered through the Engineering Science Program interweaves classical and modern physics, chemistry, and mathematics with their engineering applications. Chief among the attractions of the major is its flexibility in that students have the ability to take diverse engineering, math, and science classes based on individual research goals. The solid base in physics and mathematics is augmented with a selection of engineering course options that prepare students to tackle complex problems faced by society.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates in the College of Engineering must apply to one specific major/degree program. For further information, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Admission to engineering via a Change of College application for current UC Berkeley students is very competitive as there are few open spaces in engineering for students admitted to other colleges at UC Berkeley. For further information regarding a Change of College to Engineering, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/change-of-college">College's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>There is no minor program in engineering physics.</p>

Entering junior transfers are allowed five semesters to complete their degree requirements. Summer terms are optional and do not count toward the maximum. Students are responsible for planning and satisfactorily completing all graduation requirements within the maximum allowable semesters. </li> 	<li>Adhere to all <a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-guide/policies-procedures/" target="_blank">college policies and procedures </a>as they complete degree requirements.</li> 	<li>Complete the lower division program before enrolling in upper division engineering courses. </li> </ol> <h3><strong>Humanities and Social Sciences (H/SS) Requirement</strong></h3> <p style="margin-left:22.5pt">To promote a rich and varied educational experience outside of the technical requirements for each major, the College of Engineering has a six-course <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/student-services/degree-requirements/humanities-and-social-sciences" target="_blank">Humanities and Social Sciences breadth requirement</a>, which must be completed to graduate. This requirement, built into all the engineering programs of study, includes two Reading and Composition courses (R&amp;C), and four additional courses within which a number of specific conditions must be satisfied. See the <a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-guide/degree-requirements/humanities-and-social-sciences/" target="_blank">humanities and social sciences</a> section of our website for details.</p> <h3><strong>Class Schedule Requirements</strong></h3> <ul> 	<li>Minimum units per semester: 12.0</li> 	<li>Maximum units per semester:  20.5</li> 	<li>Minimum technical courses: College of Engineering undergraduates must include at least two letter graded technical courses (of at least 3 units each) in their semester program. Every semester students are expected to make satisfactory progress in their declared major. Satisfactory progress is determined by the student's Engineering Student Services Advisor. (Note: For most majors, <a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-guide/policies-procedures/scholarship-progress#ac12282" target="_blank">normal progress</a> will require enrolling in 3-4 technical courses each semester). Students who are not in compliance with this policy by the end of the fifth week of the semester are subject to a registration block that will delay enrollment for the following semester. </li> 	<li>All technical courses (math, science, engineering) that satisfy requirements for the major must be taken on a letter-graded basis (unless only offered as P/NP).</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Minimum Academic (Grade) Requirements</strong></h3> <ul> 	<li>Minimum overall and semester grade point averages of 2.00 (C average) are required of engineering undergraduates.

This includes transfer units from outside of the UC system, other UC campuses, credit-bearing exams, as well as UC Berkeley Extension XB units.</span></p> 	</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Normal Progress</strong></h3> <p>Students in the College of Engineering must enroll in a full-time program and make <a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-guide/policies-procedures/scholarship-progress/#ac12282" target="_blank">normal progress</a> each semester toward the bachelor's degree. The continued enrollment of students who fail to achieve minimum academic progress shall be subject to the approval of the dean.

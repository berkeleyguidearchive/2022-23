				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">Bachelor of Arts (BA)</span></h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">The Data Science Major degree program combines computational and inferential reasoning to draw conclusions based on data about some aspect of the real world. Data scientists come from all walks of life, all areas of study, and all backgrounds. They share an appreciation for the practical use of mathematical and scientific thinking and the power of computing to understand and solve problems for business, research, and societal impact.</span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">The Data Science Major will equip students to draw sound conclusions from data in context, using knowledge of statistical inference, computational processes, data management strategies, domain knowledge, and theory. Students will learn to carry out analyses of data through the full cycle of the investigative process in scientific and practical contexts. Students will gain an understanding of the human and ethical implications of data analytics and integrate that knowledge in designing and carrying out their work.</span></p>
<p><span>The Data Science major requirements include </span><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f"><span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=DATA%20C8" title="DATA C8" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'DATA C8');">DATA C8</a></span></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=DATA%20C100" title="DATA C100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'DATA C100');">DATA C100</a></span>, the core lower-division and upper-division elements of the major, along with courses from each of the following requirement groups:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Foundations in Mathematics and Computing</li>
	<li>Computational and Inferential Depth</li>
	<li>Modeling, Learning and Decision Making</li>
	<li>Probability</li>
	<li>Human Contexts and Ethics</li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">Domain Emphasis</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">All students will select a Domain Emphasis, a cluster of one lower division course and two upper division courses, that brings them into the context of a domain and allows them </span>to build bridges with data science.</p>
<h3><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">Declaring the Major</span></h3>
<p>Students can apply to declare the Data Science major after completing all the lower-division prerequisites (see the Major Requirements tab). For applicants with prerequisites in progress, applications will be reviewed after the grades for all prerequisites are available.</p>
<p>It is necessary for applicants to achieve a minimum prerequisite grade point average (GPA) in order to declare the Data Science major. Information on this GPA and the process to apply for admission to the major can be found on the <a href="http://data.berkeley.edu/degrees/data-science-ba/declaring" target="_blank">Declaring the Major</a> web page.</p>
<h3><span>Minor Program</span></h3>
<p>The Minor in Data Science at UC Berkeley aims to provide students with practical knowledge of the methods and techniques of data analysis, as well as the ability to think critically about the construction and implications of data analysis and models. The minor will empower students across the wide array of campus disciplines with a working knowledge of statistics, probability, and computation that allow students not just to participate in data science projects, but to design and carry out rigorous computational and inferential analysis for their field of interest. Check the <a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/data-science-undergraduate-studies/data-science-minor" target="_blank">Data Science Minor program website</a> for details.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">VISIT PROGRAM WEBSITE</a></p>

<p>Can machines think? Can they be conscious? Do they have rights? To answer these questions, we need to understand the nature of thought and consciousness is, and the basis of rights. In virtue of what do we count as thinking or conscious? In virtue of what do we have rights? Increasingly, algorithms are replacing human beings as decision makers. When are algorithmic decisions fair? Are we entitled to an explanation of algorithmic decisions? Is it paternalistic or anti-democratic to design algorithms that don’t give you what you want, if that will mislead you or make you unhappy?</p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p><span>The Minor in Data Science at UC Berkeley aims to provide students with practical knowledge of the methods and techniques of data analysis, as well as the ability to think critically about the construction and implications of data analysis and models. The minor will empower students across the wide array of campus disciplines with a working knowledge of statistics, probability, and computation that allow students not just to participate in data science projects, but to design and carry out rigorous computational and inferential analysis for their field of interest.</span></p>

This course engages students with fundamental questions of justice in relation to data and computing in American society. Data collection, visualization, and analysis have been entangled in the struggle for racial and social justice because they can make injustice visible, imaginable, and thus actionable. Data has also been used to oppress minoritized communities and institutionalize, rationalize, and naturalize systems of racial violence.</span><span class="deschide"> The course examines key sites of justice involving data (such as citizenship, policing, prisons, environment, and health).

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> C6 also includes quantitative reasoning concepts that aren’t covered in Data 8. These include certain topics in: principles of data visualization; simulation of random processes; and understanding numerical functions through their graphs. This will help prepare students for computational and quantitative courses other than Data 8.<br/>C6 takes advantage of the complementarity of computing and quantitative reasoning to enliven abstract ideas and build students’ confidence in their ability to solve real problems with quantitative tools. Students learn computer science concepts and immediately apply them to plot functions, visualize data, and simulate random events.<br/>
<br/>Foundations of Data Science (CS/Info/Stat C8, a.k.a. Data 8) is an increasingly popular class for entering students at Berkeley. Data 8 builds students’ computing skills in the first month of the semester, and students rely on these skills as the course progresses. For some students, particularly those with little prior exposure to computing, developing these skills benefits from further time and practice. C6 is a rapid introduction to Python programming, visualization, and data analysis, which will prepare students for success in Data 8.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Appreciate the interdisciplinary nature of data science.<br/>
Create and use visualizations to understand univariate data and to identify associations or causal relationships in bivariate data.<br/>
Formulate questions about data and perform exploratory data analysis.<br/>
Perform basic computations in Python, and be able to work with tabular data.<br/>
Run and understand basic probabilistic simulations.<br/>
Understand the syntactic structure of Python code.<br/>

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> Data/Stat C140 is a probability course for Data C8 graduates who have taken more mathematics and wish to go deeper into data science. The emphasis on simulation and the bootstrap in Data C8 gives students a concrete sense of randomness and sampling variability. Data/Stat C140 capitalizes on this, abstraction and computation complementing each other throughout. Topics in statistical theory are included to allow students to proceed to modeling and statistical learning classes without taking a further semester of mathematical statistics.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Understand the difference between math and simulation, and appreciate the power of both<br/>
Use a variety of approaches to problem solving<br/>

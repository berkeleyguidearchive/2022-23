<![CDATA[
<h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The undergraduate program in Gender and Women's Studies (GWS) is designed to introduce students to the intersectional analysis of gender, women, and sexuality, focusing on gender and sexuality as categories of analysis and on the workings of power in social and historical life. The department offers an introduction to feminist theory as well as more advanced courses that seek to expand capacities for critical reflection and analysis and to engage students with varied approaches to feminist research. The curriculum draws students into interdisciplinary and intersectional analysis of specific gender practices through investigating areas such as feminism in a transnational world, the politics of representation, feminist science studies, gender and work, gender and health, and queer visual culture. Students learn to apply methods derived from the social sciences, the humanities, and the interdisciplines to the study of gender. They explore a growing body of feminist and queer theory that revises our understanding of gender, sexuality, society, and culture.</p>
<p>Our students have a unique opportunity to interact with an amazing cadre of <a href="http://dev-department-of-gender-womens-studies.pantheon.berkeley.edu/about/department-faculty/">GWS faculty</a>. The program allows our students to pursue a broad array of careers and interests after graduation. Gender and Women's Studies students get significant personalized attention. The department is known for its investment in the well-being of its students, and its smaller size produces a supportive community among students, faculty, and staff.</p>

<![CDATA[
<h3>GWS Honors Program</h3>
<p>GWS majors can pursue an honors thesis by successfully completing GWS195 and electing to move forward to GWS H195. To be eligible for the GWS honors program, students must have an overall 3.3 GPA and a 3.5 GPA in the major. Students must have a 3.6 for honors, a 3.8 for high honors, and a 3.9 for highest honors. In addition, the student must receive a minimum of an A in GWS H195.</p>
<h3>Honors Thesis Prize</h3>
<p>The department Honors Thesis Prize is given to the student who has demonstrated excellence in research and writing of the honors thesis. The instructor of the honors thesis class will recommend the student to the faculty committee.</p>
<h3>Departmental Citation</h3>
<p>The Departmental Citation is an award recognizing undergraduate excellence in the UC Berkeley Gender and Women's Studies Department. Each year the department selects one graduating senior to receive this award for his/her outstanding accomplishments in GWS. A faculty committee reviews the materials of students who meet the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Officially graduating in spring or summer of the current year, or who have finished their degree in summer or fall of the prior year and haven't previously applied.</li>
	<li>Students are awarded the citation on the basis of scholarship with the criteria of an overall 3.5 GPA or higher and a 3.8 major GPA. The GPA includes the prerequisite courses taken for the major. All seniors can qualify to be considered for the Departmental Citation. When determining their selection, the faculty committee takes into consideration the overall GWS record and activities of qualified students, but it also focuses particular attention on the student's GWS research or project.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Excellence in Action Award</h3>
<p>The department's Excellence in Action Award is given to the student who has demonstrated academic excellence and a commitment to community service. The faculty and staff will make recommendations to the faculty committee and the committee will review and select the student from the recommended candidates.</p>
<h3>David Getman Memorial Award in LGBT Studies</h3>
<p>The Getman Award is awarded to the student who achieves the highest academic excellence in the LGBT Minor.  Prospective recipients will be identified, screened, and selected by a committee of faculty in Gender and Women’s Studies appointed by the Chair. </p>
<h3>David Getman Memorial Award in Global Women's Issues</h3>
<p>The Getman Award in Global Women's Issues is awarded to a student who demonstrates a concrete commitment to the advancement of women’s rights and issues worldwide.  Prospective recipients will be identified, screened, and selected by a committee of faculty in Gender and Women’s Studies appointed by the Chair. </p>
<h3>Research Funding for Majors</h3>
<p>Majors can apply for funding to help support the costs of GWS-related research or of presenting a GWS-related paper at a conference. Individual awards can be up to $250 for domestic travel or $300-$500 for international travel. Funding levels for other costs (e.g., copying, small payments for interview subjects, etc.,) will depend on the budget presented, but will generally range between $50 and $200. Applications will be accepted on a rolling basis until the year’s funds are exhausted. Each major can receive funding up to two times over the course of their undergraduate career, although priority will be given to applicants who have not yet received funding. Recipients will be asked to write a very brief report summarizing how they used the funding. To apply, download the application from our website and email the completed form to the <a href="http://womensstudies.berkeley.edu/contact" target="_blank">student services adviser.</a></p>
<h3>Center for Race and Gender Undergraduate Student Grants Program</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://crg.berkeley.edu/content/undergraduate-grants-program">Center for Race and Gender</a> (CRG) at the University of California Berkeley, announces the availability of grants of $100 to $1,000 to fund undergraduates for research or creative projects that address issues of race and gender. Topics should be consonant with CRG’s mandate to support critical student research on race, gender, and their intersections in a wide variety of social, cultural, and institutional contexts, especially on the Berkeley campus and its neighboring communities, but also in California, the nation, or the world.</p>
<h3>Study Abroad</h3>
<p>Gender and Women’s Studies supports students interested in studying aboard, both through the <a href="http://studyabroad.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Berkeley Study Abroad Program </a> or through a non-BSAP program. The department will work with students to ensure they have a productive and expansive experience, whether they are interested in taking courses for the major, in completing general education requirements, or in living/studying in another country and immersing themselves into that culture.</p>
<h3>Undergraduate Research Apprentice Program (URAP)</h3>
<p>UC Berkeley is well known for its dynamic research environment. As an undergraduate student there are many ways to participate in research on campus. One such program is URAP, which provides opportunities for students to work with faculty on cutting-edge research. By working closely with faculty, students can cultivate professional relationships, enhance their research skills, and deepen their knowledge and skills in areas of special interest. Applications are online. For a complete listing and description of research projects, visit the <a href="http://research.berkeley.edu/urap/" target="_blank">URAP website</a>.</p>
<h3>Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship/L&amp;S</h3>
<p>This program (SURF/L&amp;S) allows UC Berkeley undergraduates in the College of Letters &amp; Science to spend the summer doing concentrated research in preparation for a senior thesis. Application deadline generally is in the spring. See<a href="http://surf.berkeley.edu/"> surf.berkeley.edu</a> for more information.</p>
<h3>Haas Scholars Program</h3>
<p>The Robert &amp; Colleen Haas Scholars Program funds financial aid eligible, academically talented undergraduates to engage in a sustained research, field study, or creative project in the summer before and during their senior year at UC Berkeley. Each year, twenty Haas Scholars are selected from all disciplines and departments across the University on the basis of the merit and originality of their project proposals. For more information, call 510-643-5374, consult the <a href="http://hsp.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">website</a>, or visit the program office in 5 Durant Hall.</p>
<h3>Ronald McNair Scholars Program</h3>
<p>The McNair Scholars Program prepares selected UC Berkeley undergraduates for graduate study at the doctoral level. Twenty to thirty McNair Scholars are selected each year to participate in both academic and summer activities. The McNair Scholars Program aims to increase the number of students in underrepresented doctoral programs. For further information, please see the <a href="http://mcnairscholars.com/" target="_blank">program's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowship Program at Berkeley</h3>
<p>The Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowship (MMUF) program at UC Berkeley targets students with exceptional academic promise and potential for careers that will contribute to diversity and equal opportunity in the academy. The program supports fellows by providing guidance, role models and the environment and resources to strive for the highest academic goals. Fellows will realize their greatest potential as graduate students to later become extraordinarily successful faculty members and emerge as role models for future generations. For further information, please see the <a href="http://mellonmays.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">program's website</a>.</p>

The 21st century has seen powerful critiques of both growing economic inequality and the troubling persistence of domination based on gender, race and other categorical differences. Gender has a distinctive role here for many reasons: the centrality of gender to social reproduction; the historical coproduction of male domination and capitalism; and the way gender operates in the constitution of selves. Insofar as capitalism is organized and</span><span class="deschide"> distributes power and profits through gendered structures, and gendered meanings and identities are shaped by their emergence within capitalist logics, it behooves us to think gender and capitalism in tandem.

Cultural Representations of Sexuality: Queer Literary Culture explores a variety of twentieth-century literary texts (poetry, fiction, drama) produced at key moments in the “queer past.” Using sound recordings, visual art, and documentary film to enhance our encounter with literary texts, this course seeks to amplify the aesthetic dimensions of queer politics, sociality, culture and counter-culture, through sound and moving image. Over the course</span><span class="deschide"> of the semester, students will learn to situate literary and text-based modes of expression and circulation within a broader field of cultural production.</span><br/>

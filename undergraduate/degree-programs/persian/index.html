				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Minor</h3>
<p>The Persian minor introduces students to the language, peoples, cultures, histories of the Persian-speaking world. The minor develops a student's command of reading, writing, speaking, and comprehension in the Persian language and may complement the student's intended major study. </p>
<p>Students wishing to major in Persian should see the major requirements in the <a href="/2022-23/undergraduate/degree-programs/middle-eastern-languages-cultures">Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures</a> major. </p>
<p>Students minoring in Persian must satisfy the lower division prerequisite requirements. Students may also take a language proficiency exam to waive the elementary and intermediate language courses. Please meet with the undergraduate major advisor to discuss course options or plan for study abroad. </p>
<div> </div>
<h3>Declaring the Minor</h3>
<p>Students may declare the Persian minor as soon as they begin their study at UC Berkeley. Please find the minor declaration form in the Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures department or email the undergraduate major advisor. Students must declare the minor <em>no later than </em><em>the semester before their Expected Graduation Term (EGT)</em>. Please see the L&amp;S <a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/advising/planning/schedule-planning/minors">minor guidelines</a> page for more information. </p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>The Persian minor program requires five upper-division courses in Persian literature and culture. </p>
<h4><span>General Guidelines</span></h4>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>All courses taken to satisfy the minor requirement must be taken for a letter grade and be at least 3 units.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-6c299373-bc6b-9b22-f7a9-e3fbf5ac7d85">A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be maintained in order to declare and complete the minor. </span></p>
	</li>
	<li>No more than one upper-division course may be used to simultaneously satisfy requirements for a student's major and minor program.</li>
	<li>
	<p>With the prior consent of the faculty major advisor, students may take courses across various disciplines to fulfill the Persian minor culture and history requirement. </p>

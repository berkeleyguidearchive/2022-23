				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Minor</h3>
<p>The minor in Hebrew introduces students to the language, peoples, cultures, and histories of the modern Hebrew-speaking world. The minor develops the student's command of reading, writing, speaking, and comprehension in the Hebrew language and may complement the student's intended major study. </p>
<p>Students wishing to major in Hebrew should see the major requirements in the <a href="/2022-23/undergraduate/degree-programs/middle-eastern-languages-cultures/index.html">Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures</a> major. </p>
<p>Students minoring in Hebrew must satisfy the lower division prerequisite requirements. <span>Students may also take a language proficiency exam to waive the elementary and intermediate language courses. Please meet with the undergraduate major advisor to discuss course options and study abroad plans. </span></p>
<h3>Declaring the Minor</h3>
<p>Students may declare the Hebrew minor as soon as they begin their study at UC Berkeley. Please find the minor declaration form in the Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures department or email the undergraduate major advisor. Students must declare the minor <em>no later than </em><em>the semester before their Expected Graduation Term (EGT)</em>. Please see the L&amp;S <a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/advising/planning/schedule-planning/minors" target="_blank">minor guidelines</a> for more information. </p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>The Hebrew minor requires five upper-division courses in Hebrew literature and culture or history. </p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week.

	<li>
	<p><span>All courses taken to satisfy the minor requirement must be taken for a letter grade and be at least 3 units.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-6c299373-bc6b-9b22-f7a9-e3fbf5ac7d85">A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be maintained in order to declare and complete the minor. </span></p>
	</li>
	<li>No more than one upper-division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor program.</li>
	<li>With the prior consent of the faculty major advisor, students may take courses across various disciplines to satisfy the Arabic culture and history requirement. </li>

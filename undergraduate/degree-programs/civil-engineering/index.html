				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering's (CEE) undergraduate program offers opportunities for rigorous academic learning, fellowship, hands-on experience, and leadership. Classes are relatively small, so students get to know both the faculty and fellow students.</p>
<p>The program in civil and environmental engineering, which is top-ranked nationally, provides students with a strong fundamental background in engineering science, design, and practice. Students learn to solve societal problems—in California, the United States, and the world—such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Improving civil infrastructure</li>
	<li>Protecting resources</li>
	<li>Mitigating hazards</li>
	<li>Creating efficient and sustainable civil systems</li>
</ul>
<p>CEE's four-year curriculum leads to an ABET-accredited Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in Civil Engineering. Undergraduates at Berkeley have opportunities for professional interactions and community service. CEE has active student chapters of the American Society of Civil Engineers and the national honor society of Chi Epsilon as well as seven competition teams.</p>
<h3>Areas of Emphasis</h3>
<p>Students with a specific interest within civil engineering may choose to emphasize one of the following areas: engineering and project management; environmental engineering; geosystems; structural engineering, mechanics and materials; or transportation engineering. See <a href="http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/undergrad/curriculum">suggestions </a>for elective courses and the capstone design project.</p>
<p>Selection of an area of emphasis is optional. A BS in Civil Engineering is awarded whether or not a student follows the broad and general program or chooses an area of emphasis.</p>
<h3>Accreditation</h3>
<p><span>The BS program in Civil Engineering is accredited by the </span><a href="http://www.abet.org/accreditation/">Engineering Accreditation Commission of the ABET, Inc.</a></p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates to the College of Engineering will apply for admission to a specific program in the college. For further information, see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Admission to Engineering via a Change of College application for current UC Berkeley students is highly unlikely and very competitive as there are few (if any) spaces that open in the college each year to students admitted to other colleges at UC Berkeley. For further information regarding a Change of College to Engineering, see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/change-of-college">college's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Programs</h3>
<p>CEE does not offer a minor in Civil Engineering. Instead, the department offers the following specialized minors:<br/>
<a href="/2022-23/undergraduate/degree-programs/environmental-engineering/">Environmental Engineering</a><br/>
<a href="https://ce.berkeley.edu/undergrad/curriculum/minors">Geotechnical Engineering</a><br/>
<a href="/2022-23/undergraduate/degree-programs/structural-engineering/">Structural Engineering</a></p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

			<div id="majorrequirementstextcontainer" class="page_content tab_content" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="majorrequirementstexttab" >
				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><p>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>All technical courses taken in satisfaction of major requirements must be taken for a letter grade.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student’s major and minor programs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for all work undertaken at UC Berkeley.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum GPA of 2.0 is required for all technical courses taken in satisfaction of major requirements.</p>

Entering junior transfers are allowed five semesters to complete their degree requirements. Summer terms are optional and do not count toward the maximum. Students are responsible for planning and satisfactorily completing all graduation requirements within the maximum allowable semesters. </li> 	<li>Adhere to all <a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-guide/policies-procedures/" target="_blank">college policies and procedures </a>as they complete degree requirements.</li> 	<li>Complete the lower division program before enrolling in upper division engineering courses. </li> </ol> <h3><strong>Humanities and Social Sciences (H/SS) Requirement</strong></h3> <p style="margin-left:22.5pt">To promote a rich and varied educational experience outside of the technical requirements for each major, the College of Engineering has a six-course <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/student-services/degree-requirements/humanities-and-social-sciences" target="_blank">Humanities and Social Sciences breadth requirement</a>, which must be completed to graduate. This requirement, built into all the engineering programs of study, includes two Reading and Composition courses (R&amp;C), and four additional courses within which a number of specific conditions must be satisfied. See the <a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-guide/degree-requirements/humanities-and-social-sciences/" target="_blank">humanities and social sciences</a> section of our website for details.</p> <h3><strong>Class Schedule Requirements</strong></h3> <ul> 	<li>Minimum units per semester: 12.0</li> 	<li>Maximum units per semester:  20.5</li> 	<li>Minimum technical courses: College of Engineering undergraduates must include at least two letter graded technical courses (of at least 3 units each) in their semester program. Every semester students are expected to make satisfactory progress in their declared major. Satisfactory progress is determined by the student's Engineering Student Services Advisor. (Note: For most majors, <a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-guide/policies-procedures/scholarship-progress#ac12282" target="_blank">normal progress</a> will require enrolling in 3-4 technical courses each semester). Students who are not in compliance with this policy by the end of the fifth week of the semester are subject to a registration block that will delay enrollment for the following semester. </li> 	<li>All technical courses (math, science, engineering) that satisfy requirements for the major must be taken on a letter-graded basis (unless only offered as P/NP).</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Minimum Academic (Grade) Requirements</strong></h3> <ul> 	<li>Minimum overall and semester grade point averages of 2.00 (C average) are required of engineering undergraduates. Students will be subject to dismissal from the University if during any fall or spring semester their overall UC GPA falls below a 2.00, or their semester GPA is less than 2.00. </li> 	<li>Students must achieve a minimum grade point average of 2.00 (C average) in upper division technical courses required for the major curriculum each semester.</li> 	<li>A minimum overall grade point average of 2.00 and a minimum 2.00 grade point average in upper division technical course work required for the major are required to earn a Bachelor of Science in the College of Engineering.</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Unit Requirements</strong></h3> <p>To earn a Bachelor of Science in Engineering, students must complete at least 120 semester units of courses subject to certain guidelines:</p> <ul> 	<li>Completion of the requirements of one engineering<a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-guide/degree-requirements/major-programs/" target="_blank"> major program</a> of study. </li> 	<li>A maximum of 16 units of special studies coursework (courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, 198, or 199) is allowed to count towards the B.S. degree, and no more than 4 units in any single term can be counted.</li> 	<li>A maximum of 4 units of physical education from any school attended will count towards the 120 units.</li> 	<li> 	<p>Passed (P) grades may account for no more than one third of the total units completed at UC Berkeley, Fall Program for Freshmen (FPF), UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP), or UC Berkeley Washington Program (UCDC) toward the 120 overall minimum unit requirement. <span>Transfer credit is not factored into the limit. This includes transfer units from outside of the UC system, other UC campuses, credit-bearing exams, as well as UC Berkeley Extension XB units.</span></p> 	</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Normal Progress</strong></h3> <p>Students in the College of Engineering must enroll in a full-time program and make <a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-guide/policies-procedures/scholarship-progress/#ac12282" target="_blank">normal progress</a> each semester toward the bachelor's degree. The continued enrollment of students who fail to achieve minimum academic progress shall be subject to the approval of the dean. (Note: Students with official accommodations established by the Disabled Students' Program, with health or family issues, or with other reasons deemed appropriate by the dean may petition for an exception to normal progress rules.) </p>

				<a name="advisingtext"></a><h2>Advising</h2><h3>Faculty Advisers</h3>
<p>Students in CEE are encouraged to seek mentoring from CEE faculty advisers.</p>
<p>Faculty advisers (and, indeed, all faculty members) hold office hours throughout the school year to help students with course content; to advise on courses, career objectives and graduate school; to provide guidance about summer internships; to mentor students researchers; and to write letters of recommendation as appropriate. They also can be contacted (by e-mail or phone) to schedule an appointment. </p>
<p>CEE students should meet with a faculty advisor of their choice at least twice a year for academic advising.  The department hosts Academic Advising Forums each semester to facilitate advising.  The faculty advisor reviews the student's proposed academic schedule, suggests coursework based on the student's interest and offers mentoring for career development.  If a student struggles academically, as evidenced by their GPA, the department will require academic advising prior to enrollment in classes the following semester.</p>
<h3>College of Engineering Advising</h3>
<p>Students are also assigned an engineering student services (ESS) adviser in the College of Engineering. ESS advisers help with a wide range of issues by assisting with course selection and academic decision-making, suggesting enrichment opportunities, explaining graduation requirements and college policies, monitoring progress towards the degree, and providing support or referrals to campus resources to help students reach their academic and personal goals. Explore the <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/student-services/advising">ESS website</a> for detailed information on advising services.</p>
<h3>Departmental Advising</h3>
<p>CEE's undergraduate adviser answers registration questions, assists with course selection and academic decision-making, describes courses, interprets departmental policy, and makes referrals to resources on campus. The department’s undergraduate adviser is located in the CEE Academic Affairs Office, 750 Davis Hall.</p>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>Mechanical engineers serve society by solving problems in transportation, energy, the environment, and human health. The activity of mechanical engineers extends from the investigation of physical phenomena governing the behavior of our surroundings to the manufacture and evaluation of products. The mechanical engineering profession encompasses numerous technical areas, including acoustics, automatic control, bioengineering, combustion, cryogenics, design, dynamics, energy conversion, engines, environment, heat transfer, lubrication, mass transfer, manufacturing and sustainability, materials processing, mechanics of solids and fluids, mechanisms, plasma dynamics, propulsion, thermodynamics, vibration, and wave propagation.</p>
<p>The undergraduate program in mechanical engineering seeks to provide students with a broad education emphasizing an excellent foundation in scientific and engineering fundamentals. The objectives of the undergraduate program are to prepare undergraduate students for employment or advanced studies with four primary constituencies: industry, the national laboratories, state and federal agencies, and academia (graduate research programs).</p>
<h3>Accreditation</h3>
<p>Our programs are accredited by <a href="http://www.abet.org/accreditation/">ABET</a>, a non-profit and non-governmental accrediting agency for academic programs in the disciplines of applied science, computing, engineering, and engineering technology. ABET is a recognized accreditor in the United States (U.S.) by the <a href="http://www.chea.org/" title="Council for Higher Education Accreditation">Council for Higher Education Accreditation</a>. For information about how the program achieves ABET course outcomes, please see the <a href="http://www.me.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-program/program-objectives-and-outcomes-abet">Department's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates in the College of Engineering will apply for admission to a specific program in the college. For further information, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Admission to Engineering via a Change of College application for current UC Berkeley students is highly unlikely and very competitive as there are few, if any, spaces that open in the college each year to students from other colleges at UC Berkeley. For further information regarding a Change of College to Engineering, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/change-of-college">College's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Five-Year BS/MS Program</h3>
<p>This program is for Berkeley ME undergraduates who wish to broaden their education experiences at Berkeley. In contrast to the standard MS program, this BS/MS program is completely course-based. Students in the five-year BS/MS program are also able to take some courses in professional disciplines such as business or public policy. This two-semester program is not intended for students with the desire to continue to the PhD. For further information regarding this option, please see the <a href="http://www.me.berkeley.edu/graduate/degree-programs/five-year-bsms-program">department's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The department offers two minor programs, one in Mechanical Engineering and one in Aerospace Engineering. For admission to either minor program, students must have a minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.00 as well as a minimum 3.00 GPA in the prerequisite courses. For information regarding the prerequisites for each of the minors, please see the Minor Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<p>After completion of the prerequisite courses, students will need to complete and submit to the Mechanical Engineering Student Services Office (Room 6189/6193 Etcheverry) a Petition for Admission form which can be found <a href="http://www.me.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-program-requirements/me-minor-program">here</a>. The department will verify the completion of the minor and send the paperwork to the appropriate parties after final grades are available.</p>
<h3>Joint Majors</h3>
<p>The Department of Mechanical Engineering also offers two joint majors with other departments in the College of Engineering. For further information on these programs, please click the links below:<br/>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Minor programs are areas of concentration requiring fewer courses than an undergraduate major. These programs are optional but can provide depth and breadth to a UC Berkeley education. The College of Engineering does not offer additional time to complete a minor, but it is usually possible to finish within the allotted time with careful course planning. Students are encouraged to meet with their ESS adviser to discuss the feasibility of completing a minor program.</p>
<p>All the engineering departments offer minors. Students may also consider pursuing a minor in another school or college.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be taken for graded credit.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 and a minimum GPA of 3.0 in the prerequisite courses is required for acceptance into the minor program.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student’s major and minor programs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Completion of the minor program cannot delay a student’s graduation.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

Entering junior transfers are allowed five semesters to complete their degree requirements. Summer terms are optional and do not count toward the maximum. Students are responsible for planning and satisfactorily completing all graduation requirements within the maximum allowable semesters. </li> 	<li>Adhere to all <a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-guide/policies-procedures/" target="_blank">college policies and procedures </a>as they complete degree requirements.</li> 	<li>Complete the lower division program before enrolling in upper division engineering courses. </li> </ol> <h3><strong>Humanities and Social Sciences (H/SS) Requirement</strong></h3> <p style="margin-left:22.5pt">To promote a rich and varied educational experience outside of the technical requirements for each major, the College of Engineering has a six-course <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/student-services/degree-requirements/humanities-and-social-sciences" target="_blank">Humanities and Social Sciences breadth requirement</a>, which must be completed to graduate. This requirement, built into all the engineering programs of study, includes two Reading and Composition courses (R&amp;C), and four additional courses within which a number of specific conditions must be satisfied. See the <a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-guide/degree-requirements/humanities-and-social-sciences/" target="_blank">humanities and social sciences</a> section of our website for details.</p> <h3><strong>Class Schedule Requirements</strong></h3> <ul> 	<li>Minimum units per semester: 12.0</li> 	<li>Maximum units per semester:  20.5</li> 	<li>Minimum technical courses: College of Engineering undergraduates must include at least two letter graded technical courses (of at least 3 units each) in their semester program. Every semester students are expected to make satisfactory progress in their declared major. Satisfactory progress is determined by the student's Engineering Student Services Advisor. (Note: For most majors, <a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-guide/policies-procedures/scholarship-progress#ac12282" target="_blank">normal progress</a> will require enrolling in 3-4 technical courses each semester). Students who are not in compliance with this policy by the end of the fifth week of the semester are subject to a registration block that will delay enrollment for the following semester. </li> 	<li>All technical courses (math, science, engineering) that satisfy requirements for the major must be taken on a letter-graded basis (unless only offered as P/NP).</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Minimum Academic (Grade) Requirements</strong></h3> <ul> 	<li>Minimum overall and semester grade point averages of 2.00 (C average) are required of engineering undergraduates. Students will be subject to dismissal from the University if during any fall or spring semester their overall UC GPA falls below a 2.00, or their semester GPA is less than 2.00. </li> 	<li>Students must achieve a minimum grade point average of 2.00 (C average) in upper division technical courses required for the major curriculum each semester.</li> 	<li>A minimum overall grade point average of 2.00 and a minimum 2.00 grade point average in upper division technical course work required for the major are required to earn a Bachelor of Science in the College of Engineering.</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Unit Requirements</strong></h3> <p>To earn a Bachelor of Science in Engineering, students must complete at least 120 semester units of courses subject to certain guidelines:</p> <ul> 	<li>Completion of the requirements of one engineering<a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-guide/degree-requirements/major-programs/" target="_blank"> major program</a> of study. </li> 	<li>A maximum of 16 units of special studies coursework (courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, 198, or 199) is allowed to count towards the B.S. degree, and no more than 4 units in any single term can be counted.</li> 	<li>A maximum of 4 units of physical education from any school attended will count towards the 120 units.</li> 	<li> 	<p>Passed (P) grades may account for no more than one third of the total units completed at UC Berkeley, Fall Program for Freshmen (FPF), UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP), or UC Berkeley Washington Program (UCDC) toward the 120 overall minimum unit requirement. <span>Transfer credit is not factored into the limit. This includes transfer units from outside of the UC system, other UC campuses, credit-bearing exams, as well as UC Berkeley Extension XB units.</span></p> 	</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Normal Progress</strong></h3> <p>Students in the College of Engineering must enroll in a full-time program and make <a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-guide/policies-procedures/scholarship-progress/#ac12282" target="_blank">normal progress</a> each semester toward the bachelor's degree. The continued enrollment of students who fail to achieve minimum academic progress shall be subject to the approval of the dean. (Note: Students with official accommodations established by the Disabled Students' Program, with health or family issues, or with other reasons deemed appropriate by the dean may petition for an exception to normal progress rules.) </p>

				<a name="advisingtext"></a><h2>Advising</h2><p>Students in Mechanical Engineering have a number of advising options, listed in sequential order:</p>
<h3>College of Engineering (COE)</h3>
<p>All undergraduates have an adviser at the College referred to as the Engineering Student Services (ESS) Advisor. ESS advisers assist students in a variety of ways including course selection (primarily for freshmen, sophomores and transfer students), explaining graduation requirements and college policies, monitoring progress toward the degree, suggesting enrichment opportunities, and providing support (or referrals to campus resources) to help students reach their academic goals. They are also the first stop for students who wish to file a petition. Advising assignments are made alphabetically. Students who are unsure of who their adviser is should refer to the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/advising/student-affairs-advising.html " target="_blank">COE's undergraduate advising information page</a>.</p>
<h3>ME Student Services Office</h3>
<p>This office is students' primary source of department-specific administrative information.</p>
<h3>ME Faculty Advisor</h3>
<p>Faculty advisers for new students will be assigned by the beginning of October and a listing will be available online. Faculty are great sources for information regarding classes, research opportunities, and career planning. Furthermore, all ME students are required to see their faculty advisers (or go to drop-in advising) to get their advising codes before signing up for the next semester's courses.</p>
<h3>Vice Chair for Undergraduate Matters</h3>
<p>The Vice Chair handles all undergraduate student petitions and can serve as a liaison between students and their respective advisors as well as students and the ME chair. He is also responsible for the ME undergraduate curriculum and heads the Committee on Undergraduate Study.</p>
<h3>Department Chair</h3>
<p>In rare instances when issues cannot be resolved by the Vice Chair, the Mechanical Engineering chair may become involved.</p>

Phenomena of physical, technological, and biological significance in flows of gases and liquids at the microscale. The course begins with familiar equations of Newtonian fluid mechanics, then proceeds to the study of essentially 1-D flows in confined geometries with the lubrication equations. Next is a study of the flow of thin films spreading under gravity or surface tension gradients. Lubrication theory of compressible gases leads to consideration</span><span class="deschide"> of air bearings. Two- and 3-D flows are treated with Stokes' equations. Less familiar physical phenomena of significance and utility at the microscale are then considered: intermolecular forces in liquids, slip, diffusion and bubbles as active agents. A review of relevant aspects of electricity and magnetism precedes a study of electrowetting and electrokinetically driven liquid flows.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The environmental engineering science (EES) major is an interdisciplinary program pairing engineering fundamentals with courses in the environmental and natural sciences. The EES curriculum provides a broader foundation in the sciences, allowing students to take classes in a variety of departments both inside and outside of the College of Engineering. At the same time, it allows students to focus their studies on environmental issues more than is possible in other engineering programs. EES provides a solid interdisciplinary foundation that is necessary for creating real-world solutions to global environmental challenges, such as providing a robust supply of safe drinking water, and meeting societal demands for energy without causing air pollution or interfering with the Earth’s climate systems.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates of the College of Engineering must apply for admission to one specific major/degree program. For further information, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Admission to engineering via a Change of College application for current UC Berkeley students is very competitive as there are few spaces open in engineering each year to students admitted to other colleges at UC Berkeley. For further information regarding a Change of College to Engineering, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/change-of-college">College's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>A minor in environmental engineering is available through the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.</p>

Entering junior transfers are allowed five semesters to complete their degree requirements. Summer terms are optional and do not count toward the maximum. Students are responsible for planning and satisfactorily completing all graduation requirements within the maximum allowable semesters. </li> 	<li>Adhere to all <a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-guide/policies-procedures/" target="_blank">college policies and procedures </a>as they complete degree requirements.</li> 	<li>Complete the lower division program before enrolling in upper division engineering courses. </li> </ol> <h3><strong>Humanities and Social Sciences (H/SS) Requirement</strong></h3> <p style="margin-left:22.5pt">To promote a rich and varied educational experience outside of the technical requirements for each major, the College of Engineering has a six-course <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/student-services/degree-requirements/humanities-and-social-sciences" target="_blank">Humanities and Social Sciences breadth requirement</a>, which must be completed to graduate. This requirement, built into all the engineering programs of study, includes two Reading and Composition courses (R&amp;C), and four additional courses within which a number of specific conditions must be satisfied. See the <a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-guide/degree-requirements/humanities-and-social-sciences/" target="_blank">humanities and social sciences</a> section of our website for details.</p> <h3><strong>Class Schedule Requirements</strong></h3> <ul> 	<li>Minimum units per semester: 12.0</li> 	<li>Maximum units per semester:  20.5</li> 	<li>Minimum technical courses: College of Engineering undergraduates must include at least two letter graded technical courses (of at least 3 units each) in their semester program. Every semester students are expected to make satisfactory progress in their declared major. Satisfactory progress is determined by the student's Engineering Student Services Advisor. (Note: For most majors, <a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-guide/policies-procedures/scholarship-progress#ac12282" target="_blank">normal progress</a> will require enrolling in 3-4 technical courses each semester). Students who are not in compliance with this policy by the end of the fifth week of the semester are subject to a registration block that will delay enrollment for the following semester. </li> 	<li>All technical courses (math, science, engineering) that satisfy requirements for the major must be taken on a letter-graded basis (unless only offered as P/NP).</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Minimum Academic (Grade) Requirements</strong></h3> <ul> 	<li>Minimum overall and semester grade point averages of 2.00 (C average) are required of engineering undergraduates. Students will be subject to dismissal from the University if during any fall or spring semester their overall UC GPA falls below a 2.00, or their semester GPA is less than 2.00. </li> 	<li>Students must achieve a minimum grade point average of 2.00 (C average) in upper division technical courses required for the major curriculum each semester.</li> 	<li>A minimum overall grade point average of 2.00 and a minimum 2.00 grade point average in upper division technical course work required for the major are required to earn a Bachelor of Science in the College of Engineering.</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Unit Requirements</strong></h3> <p>To earn a Bachelor of Science in Engineering, students must complete at least 120 semester units of courses subject to certain guidelines:</p> <ul> 	<li>Completion of the requirements of one engineering<a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-guide/degree-requirements/major-programs/" target="_blank"> major program</a> of study. </li> 	<li>A maximum of 16 units of special studies coursework (courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, 198, or 199) is allowed to count towards the B.S. degree, and no more than 4 units in any single term can be counted.</li> 	<li>A maximum of 4 units of physical education from any school attended will count towards the 120 units.</li> 	<li> 	<p>Passed (P) grades may account for no more than one third of the total units completed at UC Berkeley, Fall Program for Freshmen (FPF), UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP), or UC Berkeley Washington Program (UCDC) toward the 120 overall minimum unit requirement. <span>Transfer credit is not factored into the limit. This includes transfer units from outside of the UC system, other UC campuses, credit-bearing exams, as well as UC Berkeley Extension XB units.</span></p> 	</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Normal Progress</strong></h3> <p>Students in the College of Engineering must enroll in a full-time program and make <a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-guide/policies-procedures/scholarship-progress/#ac12282" target="_blank">normal progress</a> each semester toward the bachelor's degree. The continued enrollment of students who fail to achieve minimum academic progress shall be subject to the approval of the dean. (Note: Students with official accommodations established by the Disabled Students' Program, with health or family issues, or with other reasons deemed appropriate by the dean may petition for an exception to normal progress rules.) </p>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>Ancient Greek and Roman Studies (AGRS) is an interdisciplinary &quot;area studies&quot; major. It provides students with the opportunity to explore the rich diversity of Mediterranean antiquity in depth, in company with a relatively small cohort of undergraduates. While language study is an option, the major may be completed entirely in English.  This major serves as excellent preparation for many different careers including law, medicine, teaching, writing, and business, as well as for graduate study in fields such as Anthropology, Archaeology, History, and Art History.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-77d9fcd0-7fff-79d9-1932-c55c43460405">To declare the major, meet with the AGRS undergraduate advisor, who can help you create a course plan and complete the declaration. You may also want to review the Letters &amp; Science advising site for a guide to </span><a href="https://lsadvising.berkeley.edu/majors-minors/declare-or-change-major" target="_blank">declaring a major</a>. For a detailed list of requirements, please see the Major Requirements tab.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-ce556fc5-39ac-5213-afd1-7254cc65435a">Students who are declared majors in Ancient Greek and Roman Studies and who have a GPA (both general and departmental) of at least 3.6 are eligible for honors in AGRS. The honors program consists of a two-semester course sequence — <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AGRS%20H195A" title="AGRS H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AGRS H195A');">AGRS H195A</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AGRS%20H195B" title="AGRS H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AGRS H195B');">AGRS H195B</a></span> that is designed to support the writing of a thesis. This thesis, which will be evaluated by an honors committee of three members, may either build on work in a previous upper division course used in fulfillment of the AGRS major or may be a newly conceived project. It is due the Monday of the 13th week of the semester in which AGRS H195B is taken.</span></p>
<p>Further details can be found online at <a href="https://dagrs.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/majors-and-minors/honors" target="_blank">AGRS Undergraduate Honors</a>. Please consult with an AGRS undergraduate adviser to begin planning to participate in honors.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The minor in Ancient Greek and Roman Studies consists of five upper division courses in the AGRS Department. Courses or seminars taught by AGRS professors in other departments may also be accepted, in consultation with the Undergraduate Faculty Advisor. One of the five courses may be taken outside of the department on campus or abroad with the approval of an Undergraduate Faculty Adviser.</p>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The learning goals should be understood in the context of the mission statement of the Department of Ancient Greek and Roman Studies. The first two components of that statement are especially relevant to undergraduate teaching and are repeated here:</p>
<ul>
	<li>To give students across the University access to the literature, history, archaeology, mythology and philosophy of the ancient Greek and Roman world through an array of undergraduate courses on ancient Mediterranean culture in translation. These courses introduce students to texts, artifacts, and ideas that are worth studying both in their own right and as abidingly influential elements in the imagination and history of later cultures. Such study deepens students' understanding of present-day issues by inculcating a sense of historical perspective that takes account of both the differences and the continuities between contemporary and ancient cultures.</li>
	<li>To enable undergraduates to immerse themselves in the language and culture of ancient Greece and Rome through its majors in Ancient Greek and Roman Civilizations, Greek, and Latin. These majors equip students with knowledge and analytical skills that can be applied in many areas (e.g., law, politics, business, biosciences, computer science and media) as well as providing essential preparation for graduate study in classics, comparative literature, philosophy, and other fields.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="docs-internal-guid-1723b9aa-dd76-06bf-7219-cb8403aa7d7b">Learning Goals for the Major</span></h3>
<ol>
	<li>Acquire a basic understanding of ancient Greek and Latin texts (in translation) and/or material culture, including major monuments, sites, and works of art. </li>
	<li>Demonstrate advanced knowledge of one or more subjects related to Ancient Greece and/or Rome (art and archaeology, history and culture, philosophy or Greek language, or Latin language).</li>
	<li>Learn to identify and understand key events, institutions, personalities, places, and concepts of ancient Greek and Roman culture.</li>
	<li>Gain a critical awareness of continuities and differences between and within cultures and of ideologies of gender, group identity, social status, and political organization.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate the ability to interpret texts and material culture and to understand the implications of interpretive methods.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate the ability to synthesize a well-organized argument from textual or other evidence and to express it in formal English prose.</li>

This course will focus on ideas about magic in the Greek and Roman worlds from about 750 BCE through 400 CE. Topics will include witches, holy men, love spells, necromancy, spirits, and mystery religions. We will examine how magic was represented in high literature (by authors like Homer, Ovid, Apuleius, and Lucian). as well as the more practical evidence of curse tablets and the Greek Magical Papyri. Consideration will be given to analyzing the relationship between</span><span class="deschide"> magic, religion, and philosophy. Our goal will be to study the common threads that connect different Greek and Roman magical practices, as well as to understand them in their cultural contexts.</span><br/>

Students will be introduced to historical and theoretical contexts that will deepen their understanding of the literary readings and support discussions</span><span class="deschide"> about comedy in other cultures, including our own contemporary experience. Assignments are designed to help students practice their skills in interpretation, argumentation, and written expression.</span><br/>

Some of the most recognizable images from ancient Greek and Roman literature are the warriors who stride across battlefields in a blaze of glory. But these heroic images tell only a small part of the story. Warfare influenced almost every aspect of life in these cultures, and not just for those who fought on the battlefield or for political leaders. In this class we will read a variety of literary works that illuminate the experience of warfare and its aftermath</span><span class="deschide"> in ancient Greece and Rome – texts depicting the battlefield, but also the stories of veterans, women at home and in war, enslaved captives and others. While we will focus primarily on literary representations of these experiences, these readings will be placed in broader historical</span><br/>

Freshman and sophomore seminars offer lower division students an opportunity to explore intellectual topics with a faculty member and peers in a seminar setting. In this course we will examine utopian literature from its classical beginnings, in Plato's Republic, and in his Timaeus and Critias (which tell the story of the lost world of Atlantis), as well as in some plays of Aristophanes. We will also consider later developments, in Thomas More's Utopia, and in such</span><span class="deschide"> works as William Morris' News from Nowhere, and Ursula Le Guin's The Dispossessed. Towards the end of the semester the seminar participants will be divided into groups, each of which will be asked to devise its own utopia on a particular theme, for oral presentation in class.</span><br/>

The ancient Mediterranean world was a world full of gods: from the poems of Homer to the small towns of the Roman empire, we can find people constantly interacting with and thinking about the gods. Myth, ritual, oracles, mystery cults, magic, philosophy: these were all ways that Greeks and Romans engaged with the divine. War, peace, health, sickness, hope, fear: these were some of the reasons for these engagements. This course explores the polytheism of ancient</span><span class="deschide"> Greece and Rome (c.800 BCE to c.200 CE), with close attention to both the ancient literary evidence and the archaeological material from the period.

Classical literature is full of mythological plots involving gods and monsters, heroes and kings. Less prominent are the kind of plots we are used to from modern literature, especially novels: plots that revolve around fictional characters invented to look like people in the street. Although these latter forms of literature are distanced from the prestigious genres of epic and tragedy, they still constitute an important<br/>
part of ancient literature. In this class</span><span class="deschide"> we will not only read a variety of texts that aim to depict &quot;everyday life&quot; (including novels, satire, letters, comedy and more), but we will also consider the underlying principles of such literature.

Religion and literature are two conceptual systems through which people and societies organize disparate experiences into meaningful wholes. In the ancient pagan societies of Greece and Rome, where a shared experience of both religion and literature was a defining element of the community, these two systems were particularly interdependent. In this course we will read a variety of texts (e.g. epic, philosophy, tragedy) and examine the complex ways that literary</span><span class="deschide"> concepts such as plot, character, closure and genre interact with religious concepts such as causation, moral justice, divine power, cosmology.

This course aims to explore the development of classical Greek rhetoric from the fifth century through the end of the fourth century BCE. In light of Plato’s and Aristotle’s analyses of the subject, we tend to view rhetoric as an art (technê) consisting of a set of methodically organized principles or norms for the production of persuasive speech. The use of rhetorical techniques, however, was widespread in the Greek speaking world well before Plato and Aristotle</span><span class="deschide"> began to reflect on its norms.

Slavery was one of the central institutions of life in classical Greece and Rome and had a profound affect on the ways these societies represented themselves and their world. In this course we will first spend some time learning about the historical condition of slavery in these two societies, then read a variety of works that show some of the ways that slaves and slavery operated in the intellectual and imaginative life of ancient authors. The three genres we will</span><span class="deschide"> focus on are philosophy, drama (both tragedy and comedy) and the novel.

What time is it? How old is the earth? Where are we located in history? For us these questions may have simple answers: we can look at a watch or a calendar or a timeline. But ancient people thought very differently about these questions. The aim of this class is to see how. We will look at a variety of ancient evidence, including literature (in translation) and archaeology, to discover how Greeks and Romans thought about the deep past (mythic time), how they understood</span><span class="deschide"> the direction and order of history, and how they organized and calculated time in their communities. We will also consider how ancient Jews and Christians came to reject classical conceptions of time and how this rejection still informs modern ideas about time and history.</span><br/>

Augustus, the first emperor of Rome, inaugurated an enormous building program during<br/>
his long reign that completely transformed the empire’s capital city. In this seminar we<br/>
will consider some of the most famous of his constructions—his Mausoleum (the tumulus<br/>
of the Julii), the temple of Palatine Apollo, the Ara Pacis Augustae (Altar of the<br/>
Augustan Peace), the Augustan Forum—and we will examine the ways in which these<br/>
new monuments helped shape</span><span class="deschide"> popular perceptions of the new system of government that<br/>
Augustus established (—a veiled monarchy).</span><br/>

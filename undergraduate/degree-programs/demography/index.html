				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Minor</h3>
<p>The undergraduate minor in Demography provides an opportunity to combine a traditional major, typically in one of the social sciences, with specialized training in population studies.</p>
<p>Although there is no undergraduate major in Demography, seniors may take graduate courses with the consent of the instructor.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Minor</h3>
<p>For information on how to declare the minor, please contact the department.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://www.demog.berkeley.edu/undergraduate-minor" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>
			</div>
			<div id="minorrequirementstextcontainer" class="page_content tab_content" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="minorrequirementstexttab" >
				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>A minimum of three of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement, for Letters &amp; Science students.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which you plan to graduate. If you cannot finish all courses required for the minor by that time, please see a College of Letters &amp; Science adviser.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed within the unit ceiling. (For further information regarding the unit ceiling, please see the College Requirements tab.)</li>
</ol>

This course provides an accessible introduction to the social science of demography. The course is organized around cases in which population issues raise policy or ethical dilemmas (example: China's one child policy). Through these cases, students will learn how demographers use models and data to acquire knowledge about population. Throughout the course, students will also learn to read, interpret</span><span class="deschide">, evaluate, and produce tabular and graphical representations of population data.</span><br/>

This course will cover the small but important part of the rich history human migration that deals with the population of the United<br/>
States--focusing on the 20th and 21st Centuries. We will use the tools of DS8 to answer specific questions that relate to the themes<br/>
of this course:<br/>
(1) Why do people migrate?<br/>
(2) Is immigration good or bad for receiving (and sending) countries?<br/>
(3) How do immigrants adapt and how do societies</span><span class="deschide"> change in response?<br/>
In addition to scientific questions, this course will also address the demographic and political history of immigration in the US --<br/>
an understanding  of which is crucial for understanding  both the broad contours of US history and the particular situation in which<br/>
we find ourselves today.<br/></span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>M.E.T. at a Glance: One program, two Bachelor of Science (BS) degrees</h3>
<p>The Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences and Business Administration simultaneous degree is part of the Management, Entrepreneurship, &amp; Technology Program. The M.E.T. Program aims to educate leaders with a seamless understanding of technology innovation, from idea to real-world impact.</p>
<p>M.E.T. students earn two Bachelor of Science degrees in one program that combines the best of the top-ranked College of Engineering and Haas School of Business. The integrated curriculum is completed in four years. Internships, career coaching, and other enrichment activities provide ample opportunity for hands-on experience with innovation and entrepreneurship. Each M.E.T. cohort is small, allowing for close mentoring and a tight-knit community.</p>
<h3>Admission to the M.E.T. Program</h3>
<p>The M.E.T. Program seeks inquisitive, self-motivated students with a passion for finding and solving big problems. It is highly competitive and is open to freshmen during the UC application period (November 1 - 30). Freshman admission is limited to a maximum of 50 students. Current UC Berkeley sophomores in the College of Engineering majoring in one of the M.E.T. tracks may apply to M.E.T. via the Continuing Student Admissions process.</p>
<p>For further information, please see the <a href="http://met.berkeley.edu">M.E.T. website</a>.</p>
<h3>Accreditation</h3>

<p>American Cultures (AC) is the one requirement that all undergraduate students at UC Berkeley need to take and pass in order to graduate. The requirement offers an exciting intellectual environment centered on the study of race, ethnicity, and culture of the United States. AC courses offer students opportunities to be part of research-led, highly accomplished teaching environments, grappling with the complexity of American culture.</p>
<h4><strong>M.E.T. Program Requirements</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Reading and Composition</strong></p>
<p>Two Reading and Composition (R&amp;C) courses must be taken for a letter grade (C- or better required), and must be completed by no later than the end of the sophomore year (4th semester of enrollment). The first half of R&amp;C, the “A” course, must be completed by the end of the freshman year; the second half of R&amp;C, the “B “course, by no later than the end of the sophomore year or a student's registration will be blocked. View a <a href="/2022-23/undergraduate/colleges-schools/engineering/reading-composition-requirement/">detailed list of courses </a>that fulfill Reading and Composition requirements. </p>
<p><strong>Breadth Requirement</strong></p>
<p>The undergraduate breadth requirement provides Berkeley students with a rich and varied educational experience outside of their major program. As the foundation of a liberal arts education, breadth courses give students a view into the intellectual life of the University while introducing them to a multitude of perspectives and approaches to research and scholarship. Engaging students in new disciplines and with peers from other majors, the breadth experience strengthens interdisciplinary connections and context that prepare Berkeley graduates to understand and solve the complex issues of their day.</p>
<p>Students in the M.E.T. Program must successfully complete six breadth courses, one in each of the following categories:</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Arts and Literature</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Historical Studies</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">International Studies</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Philosophy and Values (will be satisfied with UGBA 107)</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Physical Science (will be satisfied with Physics 7B)</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Social and Behavioral Sciences (will be satisfied with Econ 1)</p>
<ul>
	<li>With the exception of UGBA 107, UGBA courses cannot be used to fulfill breadth requirements.</li>
	<li>With the exception of Econ 1 or Econ 2, microeconomics and macroeconomics at any level (Econ 3, Econ 100A/B, Econ 101A/B, IAS 106/107) cannot be used to fulfill breadth requirements.</li>
	<li>No more than two courses from any one department may be used to satisfy the breadth requirement (<a href="http://lsdiscovery.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">L&amp;S Discovery courses</a> are exempt).</li>
	<li>Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate and A-Level exams cannot be used to fulfill the breadth requirement.</li>
	<li>Courses numbered 97, 98, 99, or above 196 may not be used to complete any breadth requirement.</li>
	<li>Breadth courses must be a minimum of 3 semester units.</li>
	<li>Reading &amp; Composition courses cannot be used to fulfill breadth requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Class Schedule Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Minimum units per semester: 13</li>
	<li>Maximum units per semester:  20.5</li>
	<li>Students in the M.E.T. Program must enroll each semester in no fewer than two letter graded technical courses (of at least 3 units each, with the exception of Engineering 25, 26 and 27). Every semester they are expected to make satisfactory progress in their declared major; satisfactory progress in the student's declared major is determined by their ESS adviser.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Minimum Academic (Grade) Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>A minimum overall and semester grade point average of 2.000 (C average) is required. Students will be subject to dismissal from the University if during any fall or spring semester their overall U.C. GPA falls below a 2.000, or their semester GPA is less than 2.000. </li>
	<li>Students must achieve a minimum GPA of 2.000 (C average) in upper division technical courses each semester. Students will be subject to dismissal from the University if their upper division technical GPA falls below 2.000. </li>
	<li>A minimum overall GPA of 2.000, and a minimum 2.000 GPA in upper division technical course work required of the major are required to graduate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Unit Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>A minimum of 120 units are required to graduate.</li>
	<li>A maximum of 16 units of Special Studies coursework (courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, 198, or 199) will count towards the 120 units; a maximum of four are allowed in a given semester.</li>
	<li>A maximum of four units of Physical Education from any school attended will count towards the 120 units.</li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-6a107e05-7fff-22c5-9386-924a0b5064b3">Passed grades may account for no more than one third of the total units completed at UC Berkeley, Fall Program for Freshmen (FPF), UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP), or UC Berkeley Washington Program (UCDC) toward the 120 overall minimum unit requirement. Transfer credit is not factored into the limit. This includes transfer units from outside of the UC system, other UC campuses, credit-bearing exams, as well as UC Berkeley Extension XB units.</span></li>

<h3>Business Administration</h3>
<h5>Mission</h5>
<p>Guided by the missions of the undergraduate program, and the University's mission of teaching, research, and service, the mission of the Haas School of Business is to develop leaders who redefine how we do business.</p>
<p>The Haas School of Business Undergraduate Program has developed student learning goals for the Business major that provide faculty and students with a shared understanding of the purpose of the major as well as what graduating seniors are expected to know or to be able to do at the end of their course of study as it relates to the school’s mission.</p>
<p>The learning goals are assessed to determine whether students are achieving the outcomes. The assessment results are used to inform curricular design and other program offerings. All steps require input and participation from the business school community, particularly the faculty. The resulting learning goals, which have their origin in the core curriculum, were shaped over several months by faculty and administration and are listed below.</p>
<h5>Learning Goals</h5>
<ol>
	<li>Students will be skilled in critical thinking and decision making, as supported by the appropriate use of analytical and quantitative techniques.</li>
	<li>Students will apply functional area concepts and theories appropriately.</li>
	<li>Students will be effective communicators who can prepare and deliver oral and written presentations using appropriate technologies.</li>
	<li>Students will be sensitive to the ethical requirements of business activities.</li>
	<li>Students will tackle strategic and organizational challenges with innovative solutions.</li>
</ol>

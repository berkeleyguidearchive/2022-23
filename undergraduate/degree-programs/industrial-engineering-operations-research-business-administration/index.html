				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>M.E.T. at a Glance: One Program, Two Bachelor of Science (BS) Degrees</h3>
<p>The Industrial Engineering and Operations Research and Business Administration simultaneous degree is part of the Management, Entrepreneurship, &amp; Technology Program. The M.E.T. Program aims to educate leaders with a seamless understanding of technology innovation, from idea to real-world impact.</p>
<p>M.E.T. students earn two Bachelor of Science degrees in one program that combines the best of the top-ranked College of Engineering and Haas School of Business. The integrated curriculum is completed in four years. Internships, career coaching, and other enrichment activities provide ample opportunity for hands-on experience with innovation and entrepreneurship. Each M.E.T. cohort is small, allowing for close mentoring and a tight-knit community.</p>
<h3>Admission to the M.E.T. Program</h3>
<p>The M.E.T. Program seeks inquisitive, self-motivated students with a passion for finding and solving big problems. It is highly competitive and is open to freshmen during the UC application period (November 1 - 30). Freshman admission is limited to a maximum of 50 students. Current UC Berkeley sophomores in the College of Engineering majoring in one of the M.E.T. tracks may apply to M.E.T. via the Continuing Student Admissions process.</p>
<p>For further information, please see the <a href="http://met.berkeley.edu">M.E.T. website</a>.</p>

				<a name="collegerequirementstext"></a><h2>College Requirements</h2><p><strong>University of California Requirements</strong></p>
<p><a href="/2022-23/undergraduate/colleges-schools/haas-business/entry-level-writing-requirement/">Entry Level Writing</a></p>
<p>All students who enter the University of California as freshmen must demonstrate their command of the English language by fulfilling the Entry Level Writing Requirement. Fulfillment of this requirement is also a prerequisite to enrollment in all reading and composition courses at UC Berkeley. </p>
<p><a href="/2022-23/undergraduate/colleges-schools/haas-business/american-history-institutions-requirement/">American History and American Institutions</a></p>
<p>The American History and Institutions requirements are based on the principle that a US resident who graduates from an American university should have an understanding of the history and governmental institutions of the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Campus Requirement</strong></p>
<p><a href="/2022-23/undergraduate/colleges-schools/haas-business/american-cultures-requirement/">American Cultures</a></p>
<p>American Cultures (AC) is the one requirement that all undergraduate students at UC Berkeley need to take and pass in order to graduate. The requirement offers an exciting intellectual environment centered on the study of race, ethnicity, and culture of the United States. AC courses offer students opportunities to be part of research-led, highly accomplished teaching environments, grappling with the complexity of American culture.</p>
<h4><strong>M.E.T. Program Requirements</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Reading and Composition</strong></p>
<p>Two Reading and Composition (R&amp;C) courses must be taken for a letter grade (C- or better required), and must be completed by no later than the end of the sophomore year (4th semester of enrollment). The first half of R&amp;C, the “A” course, must be completed by the end of the freshman year; the second half of R&amp;C, the “B “course, by no later than the end of the sophomore year or a student's registration will be blocked. View a <a href="/2022-23/undergraduate/colleges-schools/engineering/reading-composition-requirement/">detailed list of courses </a>that fulfill Reading and Composition requirements. </p>
<p><strong>Breadth Requirement</strong></p>
<p>The undergraduate breadth requirement provides Berkeley students with a rich and varied educational experience outside of their major program. As the foundation of a liberal arts education, breadth courses give students a view into the intellectual life of the University while introducing them to a multitude of perspectives and approaches to research and scholarship. Engaging students in new disciplines and with peers from other majors, the breadth experience strengthens interdisciplinary connections and context that prepare Berkeley graduates to understand and solve the complex issues of their day.</p>
<p>Students in the M.E.T. Program must successfully complete six breadth courses, one in each of the following categories:</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Arts and Literature</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Historical Studies</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">International Studies</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Class Schedule Requirements</strong></p>

<h3>Business Administration</h3>
<h5>MISSION</h5>
<p>Guided by the missions of the undergraduate program, and the University's mission of teaching, research, and service, the mission of the Haas School of Business is to develop leaders who redefine how we do business.</p>
<p>The Haas School of Business Undergraduate Program has developed student learning goals for the Business major that provide faculty and students with a shared understanding of the purpose of the major as well as what graduating seniors are expected to know or to be able to do at the end of their course of study as it relates to the school’s mission.</p>
<p>The learning goals are assessed to determine whether students are achieving the outcomes. The assessment results are used to inform curricular design and other program offerings. All steps require input and participation from the business school community, particularly the faculty. The resulting learning goals, which have their origin in the core curriculum, were shaped over several months by faculty and administration and are listed below.</p>
<h5>LEARNING GOALS</h5>
<ol>
	<li>Students will be skilled in critical thinking and decision making, as supported by the appropriate use of analytical and quantitative techniques.</li>
	<li>Students will apply functional area concepts and theories appropriately.</li>
	<li>Students will be effective communicators who can prepare and deliver oral and written presentations using appropriate technologies.</li>
	<li>Students will be sensitive to the ethical requirements of business activities.</li>
	<li>Students will tackle strategic and organizational challenges with innovative solutions.</li>
</ol>

The course is designed to cover advanced corporate finance issues. Its purpose is two-fold. First, it will help students develop a tool-box, both conceptual and quantitative, to address real-world corporate financial issues that they will likely use immediately in any finance-related career. Second, the course is designed to give the “the big picture,” i.e., sharpen understanding of how corporate financial strategy helps increase a firm’s</span><span class="deschide"> value in a dynamic environment. The course examines qualitative factors that help determine financial strategy, including the costs of financial distress and the value of financial flexibility, as well as quantitative techniques, such as option pricing, that will be helpful in various analyses.</span><br/>

This course provides a survey of innovative social movements and their complex relationships to social media technologies.

The course will place into comparative relief the discourses of explicitly</span><span class="deschide"> racially- or ethnically-defined movements and movements that mobilize based on other, sometimes overlapping categories of marginalization including class, immigration status, gender identity and occupational category.</span><br/>

This course is a lecture series that explores the food system and its critical role in our culture, well-being and survival. Students will develop food-systems intelligence—a personal understanding of how the diverse facets of the food system relate to one another, especially one's own role as a participant in the food system and how individual and collective choices, actions, policies and public and private interests affect it. The course explores personal ethics</span><span class="deschide">, complex systems, entrepreneurial agency, and ways to develop a multi-sector perspective to food-systems change making. Students will develop plans at an individual, local, national, or global scale to improve, and possibly transform our food system.</span><br/>

Energy is one of the main drivers of civilization. Today we are at the precipice of what many hope will be a major paradigm shift in energy production and use. Two transitions are needed. On the one hand, we must find ways to extend the benefits of our existing energy system to the impoverished people living in the developing world while continuing to provide these benefits to the people of the developed world. On the other hand, we must completely</span><span class="deschide"> overhaul the existing system to fight climate change and other forms of air and water pollution. Are these shifts truly within our reach? Can we achieve both simultaneously? If so, how? This Big Ideas course will grapple with these questions using an interdisciplinary systems approach.</span><br/>

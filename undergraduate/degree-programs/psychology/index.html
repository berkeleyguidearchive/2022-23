				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>Psychology as a scientific discipline aims to describe, understand, and predict the behavior of living organisms. In doing so, psychology embraces the many factors that influence behavior — from sensory experience to complex cognition, from the role of genetics to that of social and cultural environments, from the processes that explain behavior in early childhood to those that operate in older ages, and from normal development to pathological conditions. The Psychology Department at UC Berkeley reflects the diversity of our discipline's mission covering six key areas of research: Behavioral and Systems Neuroscience; Clinical Science; Cognition; Cognitive Neuroscience; Developmental, and Social-Personality Psychology. Despite the existence of these specialization areas, the program learning goals focus on fostering methodological, statistical, and critical thinking skills that are not tied to any one particular content area in psychology but are relevant for all of them.</p>
<p>The major serves three purposes:</p>
<ol>
	<li>For the liberal arts student, the study of psychology provides an avenue for increased self-understanding and insight into the behavior of others. The objective study of behavior is one of the major themes of intellectual history in the last hundred-plus years.</li>
	<li>For students preparing for training in such professions as medicine, law, education and business, psychology provides important basic knowledge and principles.</li>
	<li>For students who plan on pursuing graduate work in psychology, the undergraduate major seeks to establish a sound foundation of research principles and knowledge of a variety of content areas.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Psychology is a capped (impacted) major at UC Berkeley. This means that due to high demand, the program, unfortunately, cannot accommodate every student who wishes to major in Psychology. As part of the terms of being a capped major, all students who apply to the major and meet the following criteria are guaranteed admission:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Complete all prerequisite courses with a letter grade. Please refer to our <a href="https://psychology.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-program/major-requirements" target="_blank">Major Requirements</a> website for more information on our COVID-19 Pass/No Pass grading policies for classes taken during the remote learning period.</li>
	<li>Have a minimum 3.0 grade point average (GPA) in<em> </em>the <em>prerequisite</em> courses. (Note: GPA is not rounded up.)</li>
	<li>If you entered UC Berkeley as a freshman, you must submit the major declaration form after completing three semesters at Cal and before you begin your 6th semester. If you entered Berkeley as a transfer, you must declare the major before you begin your 2nd semester at UC Berkeley. For students on a reduced course load who cannot complete major requirements within this semester range, we will extend the window if you can apply prior to the accumulation of 80 semester units, including work in progress.</li>
	<li>Submit the application to the major by the posted deadline. Please refer to the <a href="https://psychology.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-program/apply-major" target="_blank">department website</a> for exact deadlines.</li>
</ol>
<p>If any of the above criteria are not met, students may still be admitted to the major. However, there is <em><strong>no guarantee</strong></em>. Please understand that applications will not be approved until all prerequisite courses are complete and final grades have been posted. This may mean that students will not technically be admitted to the major until the beginning of the following semester.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Declared Psychology major students may earn Honors or Highest Honors in the department for completion of the Psychology Honors program. This requires submission of a thesis of high quality, based upon independent study under the supervision of a member of the Psychology Department's faculty, satisfactory completion of the required courses, and attaining the requisite GPAs at the time of graduation (3.5 in the Psychology major and 3.3 overall).</p>
<p>Students are <strong><em>required </em></strong>to complete the following courses, none of which count toward major requirements, with a letter grade:</p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=UGIS%20192B" title="UGIS 192B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'UGIS 192B');">UGIS 192B</a></span>  or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20199" title="PSYCH 199" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 199');">PSYCH 199</a></span>  Students applying to the honors program must have experience as a research apprentice in a Psychology lab or in a related field. To demonstrate this preparation, students must have a minimum of 2 units of UGIS 192 or Psych 199 on their transcript prior to applying for the honors program. It is recommended that students begin as a research assistant in their sophomore or junior year.</li>
	<li><span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20102" title="PSYCH 102" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 102');">PSYCH 102</a></span> Statistics for Psychological Research is a 3 unit upper division course that is designed to introduce students to the data analysis techniques researchers use in the field of psychology. This course is only offered in fall and may be taken as early as the junior year. </li>
	<li> <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20H194A" title="PSYCH H194A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH H194A');">PSYCH H194A</a></span> / <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20H194B" title="PSYCH H194B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH H194B');">PSYCH H194B</a></span> Honors students are required to concurrently enroll in Psychology H194A-B (2 units per semester), the honors seminar, in their senior year. This course provides excellent supplemental background and support for preparing the thesis. </li>
	<li> <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20H195A" title="PSYCH H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH H195A');">PSYCH H195A</a></span> / <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20H195B" title="PSYCH H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH H195B');">PSYCH H195B</a></span> Psychology H195A-B is offered for 1-3 units per semester and is mandatory in order to receive honors in the major. The course is sequential with a grade of In Progress or “IP” for the &quot;A&quot; portion and the final grade assigned for both semesters at the end of the &quot;B&quot; portion. </li>
</ul>
<h3 class="introtext">Post-Baccalaureate Certificate Program</h3>
<p>The UC Berkeley, Department of Psychology’s <strong><a href="https://psychology.berkeley.edu/post-bac" target="_blank">Post-Baccalaureate Certificate Program</a></strong> is a comprehensive retraining and immersion program for students interested in applying to graduate school in psychology. The program features intensive coursework to complete a psychology undergraduate major in three or four semesters, research opportunities with our world-class faculty, in-depth advising and a supportive community. If you are inspired to enter the field of psychology, switching focus from a previous major, or changing careers, the UC Berkeley Post Bac program may be your path to success.</p>
<h3 class="introtext"><span>Minor Programs</span></h3>
<p>There are two Summer Minor programs offered through Psychology. The <strong><a href="https://psychology.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-program/minor-requirements" target="_blank">Clinical &amp; Counseling Psychology</a></strong> summer minor allows students to explore the diverse career paths of clinical and counseling psychology. The <a href="http://ihd.berkeley.edu/research-centers/early-development-learning-science/minor" target="_blank"><strong>Developing Child</strong></a> summer minor is offered in partnership with Early Development &amp; Learning Science (ED&amp;LS) at the <strong><a href="http://ihd.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Institute of Human Development</a>.</strong></p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://psychology.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

<h4>Learning Outcomes</h4>
<p>The Clinical &amp; Counseling Psychology minor allows students to explore the diverse career paths of clinical and counseling psychology. The curriculum focuses on basic psycho-biological and sociocultural mechanisms (e.g., neurobiology, social relationships, culture/race/ethnicity) that underlie common mental health problems across the life span. It also provides an overview of major theories and issues/debates in applied mental health professions across different practice settings (e.g., schools, independent practice, hospitals, and industry).</p>
<h3><br/>
The Developing Child</h3>
<p>The Developing Child minor is offered through the Department of Psychology in partnership with Early Development &amp; Learning Science (ED&amp;LS) at the <strong><a href="http://ihd.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Institute of Human Development</a></strong>. It is an interdisciplinary, developmental science Summer Minor and Certificate program, focused on children from the prenatal period to age 8. Integrating research, practice, and policy with problem-solving and implementation skills for the real world, the innovative coursework and practicum compliments many areas of study and will enrich your approach to impact-based science.</p>
<p>The <em>Developing Child</em> cohort is limited to 30 students and is available to matriculated UC Berkeley students; the Certificate is available to visiting students. All coursework is taught in English and requires complex discussion and problem-solving. Please email <a href="mailto: edls@berkeley.edu" target="_blank">edls@berkeley.edu</a> with any questions or visit <strong><a href="http://ihd.berkeley.edu/research-centers/early-development-learning-science/minor" target="_blank">the program website</a></strong> for more information and to apply.</p>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The Psychology Department at Berkeley reflects the diversity of the discipline's mission covering six key areas of research: Behavioral and Systems Neuroscience; Clinical Science; Cognition; Cognitive Neuroscience; Developmental, and Social-Personality Psychology. Despite the existence of these specialization areas, the program learning goals focus on fostering methodological, statistical, and critical thinking skills that are not tied to any one particular content area in psychology but are relevant for all of them.</p>
<p>Most of the program level goals are introduced in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%201" title="PSYCH 1" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 1');">PSYCH 1</a></span> These goals are extended and reinforced in a majority of the core courses. These include <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20101" title="PSYCH 101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 101');">PSYCH 101</a></span>, required of all majors, and the upper division Tier II courses that survey the major fields of psychology. The program is designed to ensure that all students gain broad exposure to the field of psychology. In addition, students are able to develop a deeper understanding of at least one major content area in psychology.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<p>1.    Understand basic concepts that characterize psychology as a field of scientific inquiry, and appreciate the various subfields that form the discipline as well as things that differentiate it from other related disciplines<br/>
2.    Develop an understanding of the central questions/issues in contemporary psychology as well as a historical perspective of psychological theories and key empirical data<br/>
3.    Develop a thorough understanding of one of the major content areas of psychology (i.e., Social/Personality, Developmental, Clinical, Cognitive, Biological)<br/>
4.    Develop skills to critically evaluate the presentation of scientific ideas and research in original scientific papers as well as in the popular media.<br/>
5.    Become familiar with research methods used in psychological research, and become proficient in basic concepts of statistical analyses and familiar with more advanced methods in data analyses and modeling<br/>
6.    Learn to develop, articulate, and communicate, both orally and in written form, a testable hypothesis, or an argument drawing from an existing body of literature.<br/>
7.    Apply a psychological principle to an everyday problem, or take an everyday problem and identify the relevant psychological mechanisms/issues</p>

The human brain is a complex information processing system and is currently the topic of multiple fascinating branches of research. Understanding how it works is a very challenging scientific task. In recent decades, multiple techniques for imaging the activity of the brain at work have been invented, which has allowed the field of cognitive neuroscience to flourish. Cognitive neuroscience is concerned with studying the neural mechanisms underlying various aspects</span><span class="deschide"> of cognition, by relating the activity in the brain to the tasks being performed by it. This typically requires exciting collaborations with other disciplines (e.g. psychology, biology, physics, computer science).</span><br/>

The goal of this course is to give students a strong foundation in statistical methodologies prevalent in the psychological sciences, and to prepare them for more advanced and specialized courses in statistics, machine learning, and data science. This course will cover fundamental principles underlying common statistical methods, as well as specific statistical models, largely centered around the General Linear Model, ranging from t-tests to multilevel</span><span class="deschide"> models. All analyses will be conducted in the statistical programming language R.</span><br/>

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Apply a psychological principle to an everyday problem, or take an everyday problem and identify the relevant psychological mechanisms/issues. This learning goal will not be emphasized in the class but students will learn how to formulate a psychological principle in terms of a particular model. This formulation is key to identify how particular problems observed in the student’s everyday life could be analyzed.<br/>
Become familiar with research methods used in psychological research, and become proficient in basic concepts of statistical analyses and familiar with more advanced methods in data analyses and modeling. This is the central learning goal of this class.<br/>
Develop a thorough understanding of one of the major content areas of psychology (i.e., Social/Personality, Developmental, Clinical, Cognitive, Biological). Although, we might be using examples from different areas of psychology, the student will not gain a major understanding of these content areas in this course.<br/>
Develop an understanding of the central questions/issues in contemporary psychology as well as a historical perspective of psychological theories and key empirical data. In this class, students will learn the current approaches in statistical modeling but these will be related to the more traditional statistics that have been used in the field in prior years giving the students a historical perspective.<br/>
Develop skills to critically evaluate the presentation of scientific ideas and research in original scientific papers as well as in the popular media. In this course, the students will learn not only how to formulate competing hypothesis and generate the corresponding statistical models but also how to best interpret the results from these quantitative analyses so that they can be communicated in written form in publication format or in spoken form for presentations. These skills are critical for the evaluation of scientific work and conclusions performed by experts in the field and others.<br/>
Learn to develop, articulate, and communicate, both orally and in written form, a testable hypothesis, or an argument drawing from an existing body of literature. The students will not make a formal oral presentation during this class but will be asked during lecture and section to orally explain their results and reasoning. The final written project is designed to teach how to write-up quantitative analyses and statistical reasoning within a longer manuscript analyzing a particular question in the field of psychology.<br/>
Understand basic concepts that characterize psychology as a field of scientific inquiry, and appreciate the various subfields that form the discipline as well as things that differentiate it from other related disciplines. Scientific enquiry in Social Sciences and in Psychology in particular is based on the formulation of statistical models. Each scientific hypothesis corresponds to a particular model and hypothesis testing involves comparing models in terms of their predictive power. The field of psychology, because of the complexity of the data it attempts to explain relies heavily (and more so that other biological disciplines) on statistical modeling and other quantitative approaches. Students who desire to pursue a scientific career in psychology need to be well trained in these methods.</p></div>

Neuroethologists study neural systems by combining behavior and neuroscience to understand the neural mechanism that have evolved in various animals to solve particular problems encountered in their environmental niches. This comparative approach that emphasizes how information is processed and transformed by the brain is particularly powerful for understanding neural systems. In this course, you will learn important concepts in ethology</span><span class="deschide">, sensory systems, motor systems and neural plasticity and development by studying the behavior and brains of animals such as crickets, lobsters, barn-owls, honey-bees, echolocating bats, electric fishes and songbirds.</span><br/>

This course provides a comprehensive overview of behavorial endocrinology beginning with hormone production and actions on target issues and continuing with an exploration of a variety of behaviors and their hormonal regulation/consequences. The course uses a comparative approach to examine the reciprocal interactions between the neuroendocrine system and behavior, considering the effects of hormone on development and adult behavior in addition</span><span class="deschide"> to how behavior regulates endocrine physiology. While much of the course focuses on non-human vertebrate species, the relevance to humans is explored where appropriate.

In this course, we examine the developmental trajectories that lead to mental illness in young children by: 1) understanding abnormal development in the context of normal development, and vice versa; 2) using a developmental approach to identify continuities and discontinuities; 3) addressing how mental illness develops and why; 4) learning the role genes and contexts of development play; 5) investigating multiple levels</span><span class="deschide">, and the dynamic reciprocal transactions among them; and 6) applying our knowledge to children’s real-world experiences, to better understand the mental illness, its mechanisms, and its challenges.</span><br/>

Although progress has been made in developing and disseminating evidence-based treatments for most forms of mental illness, there are still huge gaps in our knowledge base. Coverage of serious mental illness with adequate and disseminable intervention strategies is all too limited. Hence, there is a great need for the next generation of clinical scientists to contribute to the mission of treatment development for</span><span class="deschide"> mental illness. In this course we will learn about, and critique, models of psychotherapy. We will review the steps in treatment development spanning from the study of mechanisms on to proof of concept and to establishing the feasibility of novel treatment ideas.</span><br/>

We will discuss how this understanding may be different, depending on whether one has studied psychology, neuroscience, education, social welfare, public health, or public policy, and how each contributes to our deeper understanding of children’s healthy development.</span><br/>

This seminar examines how the diverse policy contexts in which children are born and raised have dramatic implications for their life trajectories. We will explore how, when and why government intervenes in children’s lives, through family, pre-/school, community, and digital media contexts, aiming to improve their developmental trajectories. From this basis, we investigate the effects of policies on children locally</span><span class="deschide">, nationally, and internationally. Drawing from a variety of case studies and empirical research, students will gain a deep understanding of policy goals, development, implementation, and implications. After gaining familiarity with early childhood policies, students will develop their own early childhood policy.</span><br/>

The course will review research on culture, race, and ethnicity and will consider the implications of these findings for our understanding of race, culture, and ethnicity in American society. Mounting evidence suggests that psychological processes are culture-specific, theory-driven, and context-dependent. This course will focus on the effects that theories of mind, person</span><span class="deschide">, self, and social institutions have on human cognition, motivation, emotion, and social interactions in American society.

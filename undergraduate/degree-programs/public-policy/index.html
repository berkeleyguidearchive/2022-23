				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Minor</h3>
<p>The undergraduate minor in Public Policy introduces students from other departments and colleges to the field and practice of policy analysis. Employers and graduate schools recognize a completed minor as indicative of broader preparation than a single degree, not to mention curiosity and willingness to do extra work. The Public Policy minor also certifies interest and background in public affairs.</p>
<p>Over the years, the department has realized that the underlying model of policy analysis enriches and complements a variety of undergraduate specializations and that public policy training can be valuable not only as a “pre-MPP” experience but also to students whose graduate training won’t include the Masters in Public Policy degree. Lawyers, doctors, engineers, entrepreneurs, and others need to understand government choices as citizens, as participants in government, and on behalf of their organizations, many of which are profoundly affected by public policy.</p>
<p>Registration for the minor (which does not obligate one to complete it) makes students eligible for various Goldman School of Public Policy (GSPP) undergraduate programs and activities and gets them on a mailing list for GSPP events of interest to anyone concerned with public affairs.</p>
<h3>Course of Study Overview</h3>
<p>The undergraduate courses in public policy deal with the substance of public policy, how it is made, how its effects can be gauged, and what the purposes of policy should be. The courses consider both the policy process and particular policy issues. By examining different policy problems in their political and social contexts, students gain a greater sensitivity to the forces which shape and carry out public policies and to the impact of social, political, economic, and legal power.</p>
<p>Courses are designed for students in diverse disciplines and professional schools. There are no prerequisites for enrollment in the undergraduate courses unless specifically noted otherwise in the course descriptions. The training provided by the courses is useful to those interested in combining the substantive perspectives of the social sciences with the immediacy of contemporary problems, to those considering professional study, and to the informed and politically aware citizen.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Minor</h3>
<p>All UC Berkeley undergraduate students are eligible for enrollment in the Public Policy minor. Students should complete the <a href="https://gsppstudentservices.wufoo.com/forms/declaration-to-pursue-the-public-policy-minor/">Minor Enrollment Form</a> as early in their academic career as possible. Declaration of the Public Policy minor is possible even before enrolling in public policy courses.</p>
<p>Please note that early declaration of the minor does not obligate students to this program should it become unfeasible later in their academic pursuits.</p>
<p>All Public Policy minor students must complete a <a href="http://gspp.berkeley.edu/assets/uploads/page/Public_PolicyMinorCompletionForm1.pdf">Completion of Public Policy Minor</a> form the semester they are scheduled to graduate in order to receive credit for the minor. The minor will not be listed on the diploma. Students who complete the requirements for the Public Policy Minor will receive a certificate of completion in the U.S. mail. Within six weeks after receiving the certificate, a notation will appear at the bottom of the transcript that will state &quot;Minor Program in Public Policy Completed&quot; with the semester and year.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://gspp.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit School Website</a></p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but they are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses used to fulfill minor requirements must be completed with a grade of C- or higher, and must be at least 3 units each.</li>
	<li>All courses must be taken for a letter grade, except <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PUB%20POL%20199" title="PUB POL 199" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PUB POL 199');">PUB POL 199</a></span>, and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PUB%20POL%2098" title="PUB POL 98" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PUB POL 98');">PUB POL 98</a></span>/<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PUB%20POL%20198" title="PUB POL 198" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PUB POL 198');">PUB POL 198</a></span>, both of which are offered on a <em>Pass/No Pass</em> basis only.</li>
	<li>Two 2-unit <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PUB%20POL%2098" title="PUB POL 98" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PUB POL 98');">PUB POL 98</a></span>/<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PUB%20POL%20198" title="PUB POL 198" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PUB POL 198');">PUB POL 198</a></span> courses or other 2-unit public policy courses may count as one course toward the minor; however, only one of these can be <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PUB%20POL%2098" title="PUB POL 98" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PUB POL 98');">PUB POL 98</a></span>.</li>
	<li>Students may count graduate level public policy electives to complete their minor requirements. Generally, undergraduates require an<a href="https://gspp.berkeley.edu/assets/uploads/page/2016_ISRC_Approval_Form.pdf"> </a><a href="https://gspp.berkeley.edu/assets/uploads/page/2019_ISRC_Approval_Form.pdf">instructor consent form</a> to enroll in graduate courses.</li>
	<li>No more than two non-public policy courses may be used to fulfill minor requirements.</li>
</ol>

We will explore the regulatory rationale in the context of microeconomic principles, the nature and evolution of energy technology and regulation in the United States, and the ways to advance public policy objectives. The class covers the alternatives to traditional cost-of-service rate regulation, the electricity deregulation</span><span class="deschide"> experiment, the resulting energy crisis in California, and current efforts to reconsider the utility business model. We will delve into how the economic regulatory framework creates opportunities to implement public policy, and the enhanced role climate change now plays in decision making worldwide.</span><br/>

In this interdisciplinary course students examine the relationships among social science, law, and crime prevention policy. Emphasis is placed on how psychological science (clinical, developmental, social) can inform decisions about individuals at high risk for repeated involvement in the juvenile and criminal justice systems. Topics of focus include risk assessment, adolescent development and juvenile justice, and prevention/intervention/correctional</span><span class="deschide"> psychology. Students will have an opportunity to master a specific problem area. Broadly, goals are for students to a) become comfortable in translating crime prevention problems into social scientific questions, and b) specifically understand how research findings can inform law and policy.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p>Leonardo da Vinci wrote, “Once you have tasted flight, you will forever walk the earth with your eyes turned skyward. For there you have been, and there you will always long to return.” Perhaps, like da Vinci, you’ve always been obsessed with airborne machines: Gliders and lighter-than-air craft. Fixed-wing airplanes and jets. Autogyros and helicopters. Or even rockets, satellites, and spacecraft. Aeronautical engineers generally design aircraft to fly within the Earth’s atmosphere, while astronautical engineers design the technology for spacecraft to fly beyond the atmosphere. Either way, the sky’s the limit.</p>
<h3><span>Major Program</span></h3>
<p><span>At Berkeley Engineering, we offer a modern aerospace engineering major that combines comprehensive topical coverage, technical rigor and practical relevance. This major has been designed from the ground up for students who aspire to become leaders in an emerging era of aerospace technologies, including sustainable aviation, autonomous flight and space exploration. With a UC Berkeley aerospace engineering degree, you can find employment in industry — such as multinational corporations that design and manufacture aerospace systems at scale, or mid-size and small private companies that develop targeted technologies — or in federal government agencies such as NASA, the FAA or federal defense organizations.</span></p>
<p>The aerospace engineering degree program will begin instruction with an inaugural freshman class in Fall 2022. </p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p><span>To declare your intention to pursue the Aerospace Minor, please use your Berkeley email address/calnet ID and fill out the following </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc5GQhRPAoxKuc0rm2_Dylp1hlPl3P84Pt78lYL6NL_2SdWoQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">application to declare</a><span> form.</span></p>
<p>Non-Mechanical Engineering major students can declare their intention to complete the minor after completing prerequisite courses <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MEC%20ENG%20C85" title="MEC ENG C85" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MEC ENG C85');">MEC ENG C85</a> Introduction to Solid Mechanics</span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MEC%20ENG%20106" title="MEC ENG 106" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MEC ENG 106');">MEC ENG 106</a> Fluid Mechanics</span>, and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MEC%20ENG%20132" title="MEC ENG 132" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MEC ENG 132');">MEC ENG 132</a> Dynamic Systems and Feedback</span>. Mechanical Engineering majors are allowed to overlap prerequisite courses. Students must have a minimum overall grade-point average of 3.0, as well as a minimum grade-point average of 3.0 in the prerequisite courses, in order to be admitted to the minor program.</p>

				<a name="collegerequirementstext"></a><h2>College Requirements</h2> <h3><strong>Students in the College of Engineering must complete no fewer than 120 semester units with the following provisions: </strong></h3> <ol> 	<li>Completion of the requirements of <a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-guide/degree-requirements/major-programs/" target="_blank">one engineering major program</a> of study. </li> 	<li>A minimum overall grade point average of 2.00 (C average) and a minimum 2.00 grade point average in upper division technical coursework required of the major.</li> 	<li>The final 30 units and two semesters must be completed in residence in the College of Engineering on the Berkeley campus.</li> 	<li>All technical courses (math, science, and engineering) that can fulfill requirements for the student's major must be taken on a letter graded basis (unless they are only offered P/NP). </li> 	<li>Entering freshmen are allowed a maximum of eight semesters to complete their degree requirements. Entering junior transfers are allowed five semesters to complete their degree requirements. Summer terms are optional and do not count toward the maximum. Students are responsible for planning and satisfactorily completing all graduation requirements within the maximum allowable semesters. </li> 	<li>Adhere to all <a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-guide/policies-procedures/" target="_blank">college policies and procedures </a>as they complete degree requirements.</li> 	<li>Complete the lower division program before enrolling in upper division engineering courses. </li> </ol> <h3><strong>Humanities and Social Sciences (H/SS) Requirement</strong></h3> <p style="margin-left:22.5pt">To promote a rich and varied educational experience outside of the technical requirements for each major, the College of Engineering has a six-course <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/student-services/degree-requirements/humanities-and-social-sciences" target="_blank">Humanities and Social Sciences breadth requirement</a>, which must be completed to graduate. This requirement, built into all the engineering programs of study, includes two Reading and Composition courses (R&amp;C), and four additional courses within which a number of specific conditions must be satisfied. See the <a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-guide/degree-requirements/humanities-and-social-sciences/" target="_blank">humanities and social sciences</a> section of our website for details.</p> <h3><strong>Class Schedule Requirements</strong></h3> <ul> 	<li>Minimum units per semester: 12.0</li> 	<li>Maximum units per semester:  20.5</li> 	<li>Minimum technical courses: College of Engineering undergraduates must include at least two letter graded technical courses (of at least 3 units each) in their semester program. Every semester students are expected to make satisfactory progress in their declared major. Satisfactory progress is determined by the student's Engineering Student Services Advisor. (Note: For most majors, <a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-guide/policies-procedures/scholarship-progress#ac12282" target="_blank">normal progress</a> will require enrolling in 3-4 technical courses each semester). Students who are not in compliance with this policy by the end of the fifth week of the semester are subject to a registration block that will delay enrollment for the following semester. </li> 	<li>All technical courses (math, science, engineering) that satisfy requirements for the major must be taken on a letter-graded basis (unless only offered as P/NP).</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Minimum Academic (Grade) Requirements</strong></h3> <ul> 	<li>Minimum overall and semester grade point averages of 2.00 (C average) are required of engineering undergraduates. Students will be subject to dismissal from the University if during any fall or spring semester their overall UC GPA falls below a 2.00, or their semester GPA is less than 2.00. </li> 	<li>Students must achieve a minimum grade point average of 2.00 (C average) in upper division technical courses required for the major curriculum each semester.</li> 	<li>A minimum overall grade point average of 2.00 and a minimum 2.00 grade point average in upper division technical course work required for the major are required to earn a Bachelor of Science in the College of Engineering.</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Unit Requirements</strong></h3> <p>To earn a Bachelor of Science in Engineering, students must complete at least 120 semester units of courses subject to certain guidelines:</p> <ul> 	<li>Completion of the requirements of one engineering<a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-guide/degree-requirements/major-programs/" target="_blank"> major program</a> of study. </li> 	<li>A maximum of 16 units of special studies coursework (courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, 198, or 199) is allowed to count towards the B.S. degree, and no more than 4 units in any single term can be counted.</li> 	<li>A maximum of 4 units of physical education from any school attended will count towards the 120 units.</li> 	<li> 	<p>Passed (P) grades may account for no more than one third of the total units completed at UC Berkeley, Fall Program for Freshmen (FPF), UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP), or UC Berkeley Washington Program (UCDC) toward the 120 overall minimum unit requirement. <span>Transfer credit is not factored into the limit. This includes transfer units from outside of the UC system, other UC campuses, credit-bearing exams, as well as UC Berkeley Extension XB units.</span></p> 	</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Normal Progress</strong></h3> <p>Students in the College of Engineering must enroll in a full-time program and make <a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-guide/policies-procedures/scholarship-progress/#ac12282" target="_blank">normal progress</a> each semester toward the bachelor's degree. The continued enrollment of students who fail to achieve minimum academic progress shall be subject to the approval of the dean. (Note: Students with official accommodations established by the Disabled Students' Program, with health or family issues, or with other reasons deemed appropriate by the dean may petition for an exception to normal progress rules.) </p>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Minor</h3>
<p>The Arabic minor introduces students to the language, peoples, cultures, and histories of the Arabic-speaking world. The minor develops <span>the student's command of reading, writing, speaking, and comprehension in the Arabic language and may complement the student's intended major study. </span></p>
<p><span>Students wishing to major in Arabic should see the major requirements in the <a href="/2022-23/undergraduate/degree-programs/middle-eastern-languages-cultures/index.html">Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures</a> major. </span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-f97fd443-bc6a-b74c-eed8-aa9bb772cacd">Students minoring in Arabic must satisfy the lower division prerequisite requirements. Students may also take a language proficiency exam to waive the elementary and intermediate language courses. Please meet with the undergraduate major advisor to discuss course options or plan for study abroad. </span></p>
<h3>Declaring the Minor</h3>
<p>Students may declare the Arabic minor as soon as they begin their study at UC Berkeley. Please find the minor declaration form in the Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures Department or email the undergraduate major advisor. Students must declare the minor <em>no later than </em><em>the semester before their Expected Graduation Term (EGT)</em>. Please see the L&amp;S <a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/advising/planning/schedule-planning/minors" target="_blank">minor guidelines</a> for more information. </p>

	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-6c299373-bc6b-9b22-f7a9-e3fbf5ac7d85">A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be maintained in order to declare and complete the minor.  </span></p>

<div>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-5bb7b061-7fff-d766-0ddf-1e21d74fc337">The UC Berkeley Art Practice Department offers undergraduate and graduate programs in studio art, which provide firm grounding in basic techniques and principles while encouraging guided experimentation. </span>Our curriculum is designed to expand students' creative, technical, and critical abilities across a range of artistic media and disciplines, and with the guidance of accomplished faculty.</p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-5bb7b061-7fff-d766-0ddf-1e21d74fc337">We provide technical and conceptual training, with a primary focus on painting, drawing, printmaking, sculpture, ceramics, digital photography, installation, performance, social practice, video, and selected courses offered in sound, animation, and game design. Art Practice majors are expected to round out the required studio courses with Art History and seminar classes. </span>The department encourages an ethical, global scope, with a necessary emphasis on diversity of viewpoints and modes of practice. </p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-5bb7b061-7fff-d766-0ddf-1e21d74fc337">Art Practice seeks to graduate students </span>with the necessary skills to have significant artistic and cultural impact, whether within the professional art world or through a range of other. creative fields, including as art directors, arts educators, and arts-related jobs with museums, galleries, arts management, design firms, publishing, and artists’ organizations.</p>
<h4><span id="docs-internal-guid-5bb7b061-7fff-d766-0ddf-1e21d74fc337">Course of Study Overview</span></h4>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-5bb7b061-7fff-d766-0ddf-1e21d74fc337">Art Practice majors need to complete thirteen courses (five lower division and eight upper division). These include ten studio courses and three courses in art history. For more details, visit the undergraduate webpage: art.berkeley.edu/major.</span></p>
<h4><span id="docs-internal-guid-5bb7b061-7fff-d766-0ddf-1e21d74fc337">The Honors Studio Program</span></h4>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-5bb7b061-7fff-d766-0ddf-1e21d74fc337">Each semester the Honors Studio Program awards studios to nine senior Art Practice majors who show exceptional commitment and promise.</span></p>
<h4><span id="docs-internal-guid-5bb7b061-7fff-d766-0ddf-1e21d74fc337">Senior Capstone Project</span></h4>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-5bb7b061-7fff-d766-0ddf-1e21d74fc337">During senior year students take the required course <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ART%20185" title="ART 185" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ART 185');">ART 185</a> Senior Projects/Professional Practices</span> and work toward a thesis exhibition in the Department’s Worth Ryder Art Gallery. </span></p>
<h4><span id="docs-internal-guid-5bb7b061-7fff-d766-0ddf-1e21d74fc337">Applying to the Major</span></h4>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-5bb7b061-7fff-d766-0ddf-1e21d74fc337">The Art Practice Department is a “high demand major” which means that not all students who apply to the major will be accepted. The portfolio submission is a competitive one and plays a significant role in the review process. Students are encouraged to submit their strongest work along with thoughtful written responses. </span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-5bb7b061-7fff-d766-0ddf-1e21d74fc337">Continuing undergraduates are encouraged to apply </span>as early as possible as long as they have completed the prerequisites, and are not allowed to apply to the major past the beginning of junior year starting in Fall 2023. Seniors are not allowed to apply. Faculty review applications once per semester. Application deadlines can be found on the <a href="https://art.berkeley.edu/">Art Practice website</a>. </p>

Taught by faculty from the Departments of Art Practice, Geography, and History of Art, this Big Ideas course is a space where we collectively study, think, and make art about the cataclysmic ecological crises that threaten our planet today. Examining possible notions of the animal, the botanic, the oceanic, the geologic, and the atmospheric, among other themes, the course prompts embodied responses to this urgent moment through complex, experimental, scholarly, and</span><span class="deschide"> practice-based interventions. The aim is to read human interactions with the planet in relation to the past, present, and future of earthly environments, as shaped by historical processes, resonances, interruptions, and movements.</span><br/>

Students study traditional Polynesian art forms through intensive workshops with</span><span class="deschide"> local artisans at the Atitia Center and create two art projects with local tools and materials in the first two weeks of the course. In the second two weeks, students explore socio-ecological processes in reefs, shores, communities and mountains through visual narratives, including sound recording, video recording, data sonification, editing and dissemination.<br/></span><br/>

This advanced studio course offers an introduction to game design and game studies. Game studies has five core elements: the study of games as transmitters of culture, the study of play and interactivity, the study of games as symbolic systems; the study of games as artifacts; and methods for creating games. We will study these core elements through play, play tests, play analysis, and comparative studies. Our reading list includes classic game</span><span class="deschide"> studies theory and texts which support game design methods. After weekly writing and design exercises, our coursework will culminate in the design and evaluation of an original code-based game with a tangible interface.</span><br/>

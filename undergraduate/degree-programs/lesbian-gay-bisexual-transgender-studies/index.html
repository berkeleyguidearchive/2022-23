				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Minor</h3>
<p>The Department of Gender and Women’s Studies offers an innovative interdisciplinary undergraduate minor program in Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender (LGBT) Studies. LGBT Studies works to establish sexuality as a crucial category of analysis in the humanities and social sciences. It draws on disciplines such as anthropology, sociology, psychology, history, literature, and cultural studies in order to document the extent to which sexuality itself is a complex cultural and historical phenomenon that bears careful examination. Just as Women's Studies, for instance, is not only by, about, and for women, LGBT Studies is not only by, about, or for lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender people — it includes all humanity in its purview.</p>
<p>A large portion of the energy spent developing this field has been devoted to discovering (and recovering) the history, dynamics, and complexities of same-sex relationships. Both those relationships and their study have had to combat a variety of delegitimizing forces originating from numerous social locations. The study of same-sex relationships within LGBT Studies has intended to provide legitimacy to those kinds of relationships, to the communities of people organized around and involved in those relationships, and to the history of those people and those communities. In working toward this end, the field of LGBT Studies has necessarily worked to theorize the concept, practice, and history of sexuality itself. It has learned to examine the various ways intimacies and sexual experiences are constructed and perceived in different periods, cultures, and social classes. The field of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Studies both addresses the particularities of the modern forms of sexuality we call lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (forms of sexuality that have only recently been able to claim for themselves the right to serious academic study) and further addresses the phenomenon of sexuality itself in all its historical and cross-cultural diversity.</p>
<p>There is currently no major program in LGBT Studies. Students interested in pursuing studies in this field at the major level should consider the major in <a href="/2022-23/undergraduate/degree-programs/gender-womens-studies/">Gender and Women's Studies</a>.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Minor</h3>
<p>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT).  To declare the minor, students must complete the <a href="http://dev-department-of-gender-womens-studies.pantheon.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/LGBT-MINOR-WORKSHEET.pdf">LGBT Minor Worksheet</a> once they have decided to minor in the program. After fulfilling all course requirements, students must complete a <a href="/2022-23/undergraduate/degree-programs/lesbian-gay-bisexual-transgender-studies/">Completion of L &amp; S Minor form</a> and submit it to the GWS undergraduate adviser at 608 Social Sciences Building. </p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://womensstudies.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but they are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>A minimum of three of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement, for Letters &amp; Science students.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which the student plans to graduate. If students cannot finish all courses required for the minor by that time, they should see a College of Letters &amp; Science adviser.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed within the unit ceiling. (For further information regarding the unit ceiling, please see the College Requirements tab.)</li>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p>The <a href="/2022-23/departments/spanish-portuguese/">Department of Spanish and Portuguese</a> offers a minor in Hispanic Languages, Linguistics, and Bilingualism. For further information on minor requirements, please see the Minor Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<p>After completion of at least one upper-division course, you can email the Undergraduate Advisor to declare a Spanish or Portuguese Minor. Please include your name, SID, and which minor you intend to complete. Your intended minor will then appear on your CalCentral dashboard below your major. For further information on declaring and confirming completion of the minor, please see <a href="http://spanish-portuguese.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/the-minor/">the department website.</a></p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://spanish-portuguese.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but they are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>A minimum of three of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement, for Letters &amp; Science students.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which the student plans to graduate. Students who cannot finish all courses required for the minor by that time should see a College of Letters &amp; Science adviser.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed within the unit ceiling. (For further information regarding the unit ceiling, please see the College Requirements tab.)</li>
</ol>

Students will study the concrete poetry of the Portuguese author Ana Hatherly, the visual (“Concrete”) poems of the Brazilian author Haroldo de Campos, and the drawings of the Swiss-Brazilian artist Maria Schendel. The</span><span class="deschide"> course content will include the multi-layered music of the Angolan duet Ouro Negro and the political essays of Cape Verdean academic Amílcar Cabral.

In exploring the persistence of a history of conquest and exchange in Brazil, this course investigates the interconnections and cross-fertilizations that have endured to diversify this country’s distinctly original national cultures. In so doing, it uses the impacts of European colonialism in the Americas and Africa as a springboard for understanding Brazil’s regional specificity. While there will be moments that recall a distant past, others</span><span class="deschide"> will shed light on a present that both resembles and stands apart from much of Spanish America in the present. Throughout the course, the literature that we will be examining will find echoes in the country’s rich history.</span><br/>

This course offers a panoramic view of Brazilian culture and history through lyric traditions and counter-traditions. Our focus will be Brazilian poems (including song lyrics) from the 19th century to the present, but we will also examine colonial and baroque texts and how they resonate with modern, mid-century and post-dictatorship literary materials. Moving through key poetic movements from simbolismo to Poesia Marginal, we will examine why the lyric</span><span class="deschide"> has been a chosen medium for authors to conceptualize identity, difference, ethics, politics and aesthetics.

When Gabriel García Márquez published his monumental novel 100 Years of Solitude in 1967 he transformed not only the history of Latin American literature, but the history of literature and culture throughout the world. But then what happened? Beginning with Márquez’s novel, and what Cuban author Alejo Carpentier called “the marvelous real” (lo real maravilloso), this course in English will explore how Latin American fiction of the last fifty years has adapted, rejected</span><span class="deschide">, or otherwise reimagined magical realism to invent new ways to narrate and respond to the world’s changing realities. While our present world might seem more nightmarish than magical, the novels in this class will provide us with the resources to imagine reality otherwise.</span><br/>

Taught in Spanish, Span 101 serves as an introduction to the Spanish sound system through an exploration of the complexities of native-like Spanish pronunciation and perceptions of native and non-native accent. Designed for both native and non-native speakers of Spanish as well as students without formal coursework in (Hispanic) Linguistics, this course centers on the acoustic nuances that distinguish standard Spanish pronunciation from non-standard</span><span class="deschide"> and non-native pronunciations. Emphasis will be placed on comparisons between the Spanish and English sound systems, and the acquisition of a native-like accent will be addressed from both theoretical and practical standpoints.</span><br/>

Conversion often refers to changing religions. This process can be personal or historical, involve a single individual or entire groups, such as at the moment of colonization of the Americas, when thousands of indigenous people were forcibly or willingly converted to Christianity. But what does it mean to convert? Is it a one-time event by which change gets effected and is final, or, does it involve multiple negotiations? Does the converter become curious</span><span class="deschide"> about and affected by the beliefs of those he tries to gain over to his religion? What implications does this have for art, technology, thought?

The course will focus on a selection of some of the most celebrated Spanish lyric poetry from the Middle Ages through the early 20th century. This will include reflection on the idea of lyric and lyric subjectivity, the continuities and discontinuities that have characterized lyric poetry over time, and exploration of some of the more striking features of lyric poetry in comparison to other forms of discourse. Our primary focus will be on techniques</span><span class="deschide"> of reading, methods of analysis and the particularities of the poems we read. Extensive prior experience reading poetry is not required; a passion for protracted attention to the language of poetry is.</span><br/>

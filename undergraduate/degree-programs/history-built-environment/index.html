				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Minor</h3>
<p><span>The undergraduate minor in the History of the Built Environment is designed to give students an awareness of the history of the built environment through a series of courses in history, architectural history, and cultural landscape. It is offered to all majors. The college’s purpose in offering minors is twofold: to provide a secondary focus to a student’s degree and to bring these additional courses together into a coherent pattern.</span></p>
<p>There is no major program; students interested in pursuing this course of study at the major level should consider the <a href="/2022-23/undergraduate/degree-programs/architecture/">BA in Architecture program</a>.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Minor</h3>
<p>A letter grade of C- or higher in ENV DES 1 is required to declare the minor. <span style="font-size:1em">To declare, students must submit the </span><a href="https://ced.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-advising/forms-documents/" style="font-size: 1em;" target="_blank">CED Minor Declaration Form</a><span style="font-size:1em">, available on the CED website. Once this request has been approved, you will see the minor added to your Cal Central student profile. It is your responsibility to track your progress towards minor completion using the Academic Progress Report and CED Advising Services. </span></p>
<p>DEADLINE TO SUBMIT FORM: One semester prior to a students final semester. </p>

This class focuses on the significance of the physical environment in human life as citizens and as future design professionals and it introduces students to the field of<br/>
human–environment studies. It shows how the social sciences and design can be mutually engaged, enriching the context for design evaluation and critique. Berkeley has long been known<br/>

How do buildings form and inform the ways in which we live — as individuals and as part of different communities? This course explores the multiple ways in which people and buildings interact. Our cultural and economic practices shape the form of our environment which in turn shapes social constructions of gender, race and class. At the same time, as individuals, we are always making choices about how we use our spaces. Intended as a gateway to</span><span class="deschide"> advanced architectural humanities classes, the course is organized around three themes that highlight ways of thinking about individual actions, social constructions of gender, race and class, and cultural associations of the built environment.</span><br/>

This class introduces students to the history and practice of design theory from the late 19th century to the present, with emphasis on developments of the last four decades. Readings and lectures explore specific constellations of theory and practice in relation to changing social and historical conditions. The course follows the rise of modernist design thinking, with particular emphasis on the growing influence of technical rationality across</span><span class="deschide"> multiple fields in the post World War II period. Systematic approaches based in cybernetics and operations research (amongst others) are examined in the context of wider attempts to develop a science of design. Challenges to modernist design thinking, through advocacy planning and community-based design, the influence of social movements and countercultures, and parallel developments in postmodernism within and beyond architecture, provide the critical background for consideration of recent approaches to design theory, including those informed by developments in digital media and technology, environmental and ecological concerns, questions surrounding the globalization of architectural production, and the development of new materials.</span><br/>

This seminar examines the relationship between architecture and the processes associated with globalization. The social and spatial changes connected to the global economic restructuring of the last four decades are explored in relation to disctinctive national conditions and their connection to historical forces such as colonization and imperialism. Theoretical arguments about international urban political economy, uneven development, deindustrialization</span><span class="deschide">, and the growth of tourism and service industries, are grounded in specific urban and architectural contexts. Case studies explore issues such as urban entrepreneurialism and the branding of cities and nationstates; heritage practices and the postcolonial politics of place; border cities, and the urbanism of transnational production; cities, terrorism, and the global architecture of security; critical regionalism, localism, and other responses to debates on place and placelessness. Readings and class discussions examine course themes in a comparative framework and consider their implications for architectural design, education, and professional practice.</span><br/>

The concept of space as it is applied to the fields of architecture, geography and urbanism can be understood as a barometer of the condition that we call &quot;modernity.&quot; This course explores connections between the larger cultural frameworks of the past century, and the idea of space as it has been perceived, conceived and lived during this period. Readings include essays from the disciplines of philosophy, geography, architecture</span><span class="deschide">, landscape, and urbanism, and short works of fiction that illustrate and elucidate the spatial concepts. The readings are grouped according to themes that form the foundation for weekly seminar discussions.

This course provides undergraduates and graduates with an introduction to issues of physical building performance including building thermodynamics, daylighting, and solar control. The course presents the fundamentals of building science while recongnizing the evolving nature of building technologies, energy efficiency, ecology, and responsible design. The course begins with a detailed explication of the thermal properties of materials, heat</span><span class="deschide"> transfer through building assemblies, balance point temperature, solar geometry, and shading analysis. Students apply these principles later in the course to a design project. The latter part of the course also provides a survey of broader building science topics including mechanical system design, microclimate, and current developments in energy-efficient design.</span><br/>

In profound buildings, the structural system, construction materials, and architectural form work together to create an integrated work of art. Current practice segregates these three areas by assigning separate and rigid roles to 1) an engineer, 2) a contractor, and 3) an architect. The goal of this class is to blur these traditional boundaries and erase the intellectual cleft though hands-on experience. Students are given weekly assignments which focus on one or more</span><span class="deschide"> of the three areas. They may be asked to analyze a structure, to construct something from actual materials, or research a case study and present it to the class. Each assignment to geared to help students integrate construction and structural issues into their architectural design, so that they can maintain control of the entire design process.</span><br/>

This introduction to the materials and processes of construction takes architecture from design to realization. The course will cover four material groups commonly used in two areas of the building assembly (structure and envelope): wood, concrete, steel, and glass. You will understand choices available and how materials are conventionally used. By observing construction, you'll see how our decisions affect the size of materials, connections</span><span class="deschide">, and where they are assembled. Architects must understand not only conventions, but also the potential in materials, so we will also study unusual and new developments.</span><br/>

The Great Depression and World War II are arguably the two most influential events for the development of the built environment in the 20th century. Not only did they alter the socio-economic and political landscape on which architecture and urban planning depend, but they also led to technological innovations and vital debates about the built environment. This course examines the 1930's and 1940's topically, studying the work of the New Deal, corporate responses</span><span class="deschide"> to the Depression and war, the important connections between architecture and advertising, the role of the Museum of Modern Art in the promotion of Modernism, the concept of the ideal house, and key tests, theories, and projects from the period.</span><br/>

This seminar provides an introduction to architectural theory since 1945, with emphasis on developments over the last three decades. Class readings and discussions explore the post-World War II crisis within modernism, postmodernism within and beyond architectural culture, and more recent developments around issues such as rapid urbanization, sustainability, the politics of cultural identity, and globalization. Transformations in architectural theory are examined</span><span class="deschide"> in relation to historical forces such as the economy, the growth and transformation of cities, and the changing relationship between design professions and disciplines. The influences of digital media, new materials and production techniques on architectural education and practice are explored and the implications for architectural theory assessed. Key issues are anchored in case studies of buildings, urban spaces, and the institutions and agents of architectural culture.</span><br/>

The first half of this course surveys American architecture from Colonial times to contemporary trends. Stylistic and spatial analysis is linked with the socioeconomic, political, and environmental influences on architecture, issues on originality, American exceptionalism, the influence from abroad, regionalism, and the role of technology. The second half delves more deeply into the history of specific building types--house, church, museum, library--grafting the earlier</span><span class="deschide"> themes onto a history of modern institutions as they took shape in the United States.</span><br/>

Many California architects came from other places: Maybeck from New York via the<br/>
Ecole des Beaux Arts; Schindler and Neutra from Vienna; Frank Gehry from Chicago.<br/>
But, once they arrived, their encounters with the Golden State produced new and original<br/>
forms of architecture. This seminar will examine the qualities of the state’s environment,<br/>
culture, economy, and population that have produced unique buildings and landscapes<br/>
during</span><span class="deschide"> the 20th century. It will look at both Northern and Southern California architecture,<br/>
starting with canonical designers then moving beyond them to consider lesser-known<br/>
regional architects whose work embodies local characteristics.</span><br/>

This course explores architectural visions as historical windows, examining them from a number of angles. Using a variety of case studies drawn from different media (architectural theory, film, advertisements, architectural projects, and so on) and periods (turn of the century, the Modern Movement, Depression, World War II, 1960's, etc,) it provides a sampling of possibilities and models for the final student project, an in-depth, original research paper. Several</span><span class="deschide"> themes thread their way through the course, including the role of the &quot;unbuilt&quot; in architectural practice; the uses of the future in the construction of national and personal identities, cultural narratives, and modern mythologies; and the importance of the future as cliche, and the role of play in cultural production.</span><br/>

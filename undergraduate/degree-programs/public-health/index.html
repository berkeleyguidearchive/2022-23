				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The School of Public Health (a graduate school) offers an undergraduate major through the <a href="http://ls.berkeley.edu/">College of Letters &amp; Science</a>. The goal of the major is to provide students with an understanding of epidemiology, biostatistics, environmental health, health behavior, and health policy. These areas of emphasis range across the spectrum of natural science to social science.  <span>Public health is the interdisciplinary science of preventing disease and injury to improve the health of communities and populations. Public health professionals work to identify solutions to address complex issues as wide ranging as air pollution, chronic disease, gun violence, infectious diseases, tobacco control and mental health. </span></p>
<p>The School of Public Health offers a <a href="https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate/" target="_blank">major</a> and <a href="https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate/global-public-health/" target="_blank">summer minor</a>. The curriculum prepares students to become changemakers in public health, for a more equitable and just world.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Although the major remains capped (impacted), the department encourages all qualified students to apply. To qualify, students must have completed the prerequisites in math, biology, and the social sciences. For further information regarding these prerequisites, please see the Major Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<p>Students should apply to the Public Health major after completion of the lower division requirements. Non-transfer students must apply to the major by the end of their fifth semester in attendance at UC Berkeley. Transfer students must apply by the end of their first semester in attendance at UC Berkeley. </p>
<p>After completing the <a href="http://www.sph.berkeley.edu/undergraduate-major/preparing-apply">prerequisites</a>, students should submit an application, which includes the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>A review of an applicant's academic preparation (Coursework and GPA)</li>
	<li>Two essays (Statement of Purpose and Personal History Statement)</li>
	<li>Resume or CV</li>
</ol>
<p>For more information, please see the <a href="http://sph.berkeley.edu/undergraduate-options/how-apply">School of Public Health website</a>.</p>
<p>While completing the prerequisites for Public Health, students should also take the necessary steps to prepare themselves to declare an alternate major.<strong> </strong>While the department will do its best to bring in all qualified students, there is no guarantee that any one particular student will be admitted into the major. Therefore, students interested in the Public Health major should prepare an alternate major in case they are not admitted into the major. Public health demands everyone's attention — there are myriad undergraduate majors at UC Berkeley that will help students prepare to work in this field. All students interested in the major, or the field of public health in general, are encouraged to consult with an academic adviser.</p>
<h3>Summer Minor or Certificate Program</h3>
<p>Public health seeks to improve human health through the development and application of knowledge that prevents disease, protects the public from harm, and promotes health throughout the state, the nation, and the world. Under the global public health summer minor or certificate, students will develop and apply knowledge from multiple disciplines for the promotion and protection of the health of the human population, giving due consideration to principles of human rights and many cultural perspectives in our multicultural country and world. The summer minor or certificate can serve as a precursor to further study in public health, other health professions, or any fields in which the health of persons and populations is a relevant concern. The summer minor can augment and enhance many different undergraduate bachelor degree programs and prepare students for professional and academic careers. In addition, public health is of interest for its own sake, as a component of a rigorous liberal arts education. Please note: the Summer Minor is only available to Berkeley students, and the Summer Certificate is only available to non-Berkeley students.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://sph.berkeley.edu/undergraduate-major/majoring-public-health" target="_blank">Visit School Website</a></p>

<p>The undergraduate Public Health program accepts Advanced Placement (AP) units for the Social Sciences and Math Prerequisites. AP scores of 3, 4, or 5 are acceptable for the following courses:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Psychology for PSYCH 1 or PSYCH 2</li>
	<li>Economics (both micro and macro) for ECON 1, 2, or 3</li>
	<li>Government for POL SCI 2 or 4</li>
	<li>Math
	<ul>
		<li>A minimum score of a 3 on the Math AB or BC exam is equivalent to MATH 1A.</li>
		<li>A score of 5 on the BC Math is equivalent to MATH 1A and 1B</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>If students have taken both an AP exam and the equivalent college-level course, we will only take the grade from the college-level course into consideration for admissions purposes. For AP Government, students may take either POL SCI 2 or 4 in combination with their AP score. </p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Summer Minor Requirements</h2><h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The summer Global Public Health Minor/Certificate explores health-related issues affecting populations in the United States and worldwide. Students complete courses covering a range of disciplines and methods relevant to promotion and protection of human health, emerging health issues, healthcare systems, and approaches to address and intervene. It will expand knowledge and comprehension of domestic and international challenges for human health. Valuable internship experience, completed locally, nationally, or abroad, and the development of both technical and public health practice skills is part of the available curriculum. The certificate can be pursued by non-UC Berkeley students in or outside of California, including international students. </p>
<p>Please note: This program option is only available during the summer.</p>
<h4>The two options available are described below:</h4>
<p><strong>Summer Global Public Health Minor for UC Berkeley students: </strong>The Summer Minor in Global Public Health consists of three core and two elective courses taught in two consecutive, six-week summer sessions. Completion of core courses and any two electives listed below will satisfy the minor. A local or global<strong> </strong>public health 8-week internship with a required seminar can also serve as one of the elective courses. Students declaring a minor must do so in writing to the Director of Undergraduate Program at the School of Public Health. <em>The minor can be completed in one or two summers. Students pursuing the 8-week internship as one elective will need two summers to complete the minor.</em></p>
<p><span class="s1"><strong>Summer Global Public Health Certificate for non-UC Berkeley students:</strong> The Summer Certificate in Global Public Health consists of three core and two elective courses taught in two consecutive, six-week summer sessions. Once the required core courses are completed, any two electives listed below will satisfy the requirements of the certificate. <em>The certificate can be completed in one or two summers.</em></span></p>
<p>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</p>
<p>UC Berkeley and visiting students who do not want to declare the minor or receive a certificate, but are interested in these classes may enroll in as many courses as they wish.</p>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The joint major programs are designed for students who wish to undertake study in two areas of engineering in order to qualify for employment in either field or for positions in which competence in two fields is required. The joint majors contain comparable proportions of coursework in both major fields. While they require slightly increased course loads, they can be completed in four years. Both majors are shown on the student's transcript of record. Students in this joint major program are concurrently enrolled in both the College of Engineering and the College of Chemistry, but their college of residence will be Chemistry.</p>
<p>Many of the engineering problems facing the nation in the next decades will require solutions by engineers who have training in both chemical process engineering and materials engineering. Three typical examples are coal gasification and liquefaction, extraction of metals from low-grade ores and wastes, and environmental control of metallurgical processes. Students completing this joint major will successfully compete for positions in diverse industries and top graduate programs.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Joint Major</h3>
<p>Admission to the joint major programs is closed to freshmen. Continuing students may petition for a change to a joint major program after their first year. For further details regarding how to declare the joint major, please contact the College of Chemistry.</p>

				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><p>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, listed on the College Requirements tab, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be maintained in all courses undertaken at UC Berkeley, including those from UC Summer Sessions, UC Education Abroad Program, UC Berkeley in Washington Program, and XB courses from University Extension.</li>
	<li>A minimum GPA of 2.0 in all courses taken in the college is required in order to advance and continue in the upper division.</li>
	<li>A minimum GPA of 2.0 in all upper division courses taken at the University is required to satisfy major requirements.</li>
	<li>Students in the College of Chemistry who receive a grade of D+ or lower in a chemical and biomolecular engineering or chemistry course for which a grade of C- or higher is required must repeat the course at UC Berkeley.</li>
</ol>
<p>For information regarding grade requirements in specific courses, please see the notes sections below.</p>
<p>For information regarding residence requirements and unit requirements, please see the College Requirements tab.</p>
<p>Please note, the Academic Guide is updated only once a year. For the most current information on requirements please a look at the College of Chemistry <a href="https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/ugrad/degrees/cheme/joint-majors" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>

<p>The technical curriculum in chemical engineering seeks to provide students with a broad education emphasizing an excellent foundation in scientific and engineering fundamentals.</p>
<h5>Learning Goals</h5>
<p>1-An ability to identify, formulate, and solve complx engineering problems by applying the principles of engineering, science, and mathematics</p>
<p>2-An ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors</p>
<p>3-An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences</p>
<p>4-An ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context</p>
<p>5-An ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives</p>
<p>6-An ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions</p>
<p>7-An ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies</p>

This course for upper division students in science and engineering disciplines covers energy and climate and specific technologies that can be implemented to reduce global warming. Topics include renewable energy (wind and solar), carbon management technologies including Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage, and Negative Emissions Technologies. The technologies will be described and compared from an upper level chemical engineering perspective that includes fundamental</span><span class="deschide"> concepts in thermodynamics and separations. We will also cover carbon economics and policies and life-cycle analysis. The course will be framed from a systems-thinking perspective.

This course is intended to give students the opportunity to expand their knowledge of topics related to biomedical materials selection and design. Structure-property relationships of biomedical materials and their interaction with biological systems will be addressed. Applications of the concepts developed include blood-materials compatibility, biomimetic materials, hard and soft tissue-materials interactions, drug delivery, tissue engineering</span><span class="deschide">, and biotechnology.</span><br/>

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> The course is separated into four parts spanning the principles of synthetic materials and surfaces, principles of biological materials, biological performance of materials and devices, and state-of-the-art materials design. Students are required to attend class and master the material therein. In addition, readings from the clinical, life and materials science literature are assigned. Students are encouraged to seek out additional reference material to complement the readings assigned. A mid-term examination is given on basic principles (parts 1 and 2 of the outline). A comprehensive final examination is given as well. <br/>The purpose of this course is to introduce students to problems associated with the selection and function of biomaterials. Through class lectures and readings in both the physical and life science literature, students will gain broad knowledge of the criteria used to select biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance. Materials used in devices for medicine, dentistry, tissue engineering, drug delivery, and the biotechnology industry will be addressed.<br/>
<br/>This course also has a significant design component (~35%). Students will form small teams (five or less) and undertake a semester-long design project related to the subject matter of the course. The project includes the preparation of a paper and a 20 minute oral presentation critically analyzing a current material-tissue or material-solution problem. Students will be expected to design improvements to materials and devices to overcome the problems identified in class with existing materials.<br/></p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> <br/>
Apply math, science &amp; engineering principles to the understanding of soft materials, surface chemistry, DLVO theory, protein adsorption kinetics, viscoelasticity, mass diffusion, and molecular (i.e., drug) delivery kinetics.<br/>
<br/>
•<br/>
Design experiments and analyze data from the literature in the context of the class design project.<br/>
Apply core concepts in materials science to solve engineering problems related to the selection biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance.<br/>
Develop an understanding of the social, safety and medical consequences of biomaterial use and regulatory issues associated with the selection of biomaterials in the context of the silicone breast implant controversy and subsequent biomaterials crisis.<br/>
Work independently and function on a team, and develop solid communication skills (oral, graphic &amp; written) through the class design project.<br/>
•<br/>
Understanding of the origin of surface forces and interfacial free energy, and how they contribute to the development of the biomaterial interface and ultimately biomaterial performance.<br/></p></div>

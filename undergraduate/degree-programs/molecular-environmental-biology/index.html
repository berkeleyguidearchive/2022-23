				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Molecular Environmental Biology (MEB) major is designed to expose students to the organization and function of biological organisms. Molecular approaches are expected to play an increasing role in environmental problem-solving in the near future, and their success will depend upon a sound understanding of biological principles from molecular through ecological levels. The program trains students in the organization and function of biological organisms and their integration into the environment.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Advice on admission for freshmen and transfer students can be found on the <a href="/2022-23/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/#admissionstext" target="_blank">Rausser College Admissions Guide</a> page or the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/prospective-students" target="_blank">Rausser College Prospective Student website</a>. Freshman students may apply directly to the major, or they may select the Rausser College of Natural Resource's undeclared option and declare the major by the end of their fourth semester. Transfer students apply directly to the major through the UC application.</p>
<p>Information for current Berkeley students who would like to declare the major after admission, including information on change of major or change of college, please see chapter 6 of the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">Rausser College of Natural Resources Undergraduate Student Handbook</a><a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook">.</a> Students can meet with peer advisors or academic advisors for full guidance. </p>
<ul>
	<li>There is a 3.0 GPA requirement to transfer into the Rausser College of Natural Resources from other colleges on campus.</li>
	<li>Required pre-requisite courses to declare the Molecular Environmental Biology major are: <a href="/2022-23/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/reading-composition-requirement/" target="_blank">Reading &amp; Composition Part A and Part B</a>, Chemistry 1A/1AL and 3A/3AL, one semester of Biology (1A/1AL or 1B), Math 1A or 16A or 10A, and a second quantitative course in either Math (1B, 16B, 10B) or Statistics (STAT 2, C8, 20, 131A, PB HLTH 141, 142, W142).
	<ul>
		<li>It is recommended that students complete the ESPM lower-division core courses prior to declaring.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Undeclared students in Rausser College must declare a major by the end of their fourth semester. Failure to declare a major by junior standing will result in a registration block on further enrollment.</li>
	<li>Current UC Berkeley students who entered as freshmen are expected to be able to graduate in a total of 8 semesters (summers excluded). Exceptions are rarely granted. Students should be progressing in major requirements each semester.</li>
	<li>All major requirements must be taken for a letter grade and passed with a C- or better (including breadth). Please see the College Requirements page for any exceptions to this policy.</li>
	<li>Both halves of the Reading and Composition requirement must be completed by the end of the fourth semester. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Students with a grade point average (GPA) of 3.6 or higher may enroll in the Rausser College of Natural Resources Honors Program (ESPM H196) once they have reached upper-division standing. To fulfill the program requirements, students design, conduct, and report on an individual research project working with a faculty sponsor. For further information on registering for the Honors Symposium and on Honors requirements, please see the <a href="http://nature.berkeley.edu/site/honors_program.php">Rausser College of Natural Resources website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>There is no minor program in Molecular Environmental Biology.</p>

				<a name="collegerequirementstext"></a><h2>College Requirements</h2> <p><a href="/2022-23/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/reading-composition-requirement/">Reading and Composition</a></p> <p>In order to provide a solid foundation in reading, writing and critical thinking all majors in the College require two semesters of lower division work in composition. Students must complete a first-level reading and composition course by the end of their second semester and a second-level course by the end of their fourth semester.</p> <p><a href="/2022-23/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/foreign-language-requirement/">Foreign Language</a>: <strong>EEP Majors only</strong></p> <p>The Foreign Language requirement is only required by Environmental Economics and Policy (EEP) majors. It may be satisfied by demonstrating proficiency in reading comprehension, writing, and conversation in a foreign language equivalent to the second semester college level, either by passing an exam or by completing approved course work.</p> <p><a href="/2022-23/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/quantitative-reasoning-requirement/">Quantitative Reasoning</a>: <strong>EEP Majors only</strong></p> <p>The Quantitative Reasoning requirement is only required by Environmental Economics and Policy (EEP) majors. The requirement may be satisfied by exam or by taking an approved course.</p> <h3>Undergraduate Breadth</h3> <p>Undergraduate breadth provide Berkeley students with a rich and varied educational experience outside of their major program and many students complete their breadth courses in their first two years. Breadth courses are built into the Rausser College major requirements and each major requires a different number of breath courses and categories. The EEP major is the only college major that requires the entire 7 course breadth. Refer to the major snapshots on each <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/majors-minors" target="_blank">Rausser College major page</a> for additional information. </p> <h3>High School Exam Credit</h3> <p>Rausser College students may apply high school exam credit (Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, A-Level Exam) towards many College and Major Requirements. See <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/courses-grades#AP%20Exam%20Equivalency%20Chat" target="_blank">AP Exam Equivalency Chart and Higher Level IB Exam Equivalency Chart</a> in the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">Rausser College Student Handbook</a> for more information.</p> <h3>Unit Requirements</h3> <p>Students must complete at least 120 semester units of courses subject to certain guidelines:</p> <ul> 	<li>At least 36 units must be upper division courses, including a minimum of 15 units of upper division courses in the Rausser College. </li> 	<li>A maximum of 16 units of Special Studies coursework (courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, 198, or 199) is allowed towards the 120 units; a maximum of four is allowed in a given semester.</li> 	<li>A maximum of 4 units of Physical Education from any school attended will count towards the 120 units.</li> 	<li>Students may receive unit credit for courses graded P (including P/NP units taken through EAP) up to a limit of one-third of the total units taken and passed on the Berkeley campus at the time of graduation.  Courses taken for P/NP in the Spring 2020 semester will not count toward this limit.</li> </ul> <h4>Semester Unit Minimum</h4> <p>All Rausser College students must enroll in at least 12 units each fall and spring semester.</p> <h4>Semester Unit Maximum</h4> <p>To request permission to take more than 20.5 units in a semester, please see the major adviser.</p> <h3>Semester Limit</h3> <p>Students admitted as freshmen must graduate within 8 fall/spring semesters at UC Berkeley. Students admitted as transfer students must graduate within 4 fall/spring semesters at UC Berkeley. Students who go on EAP and UCDC can petition for additional semesters. Other UC-affiliated programs, such as the Gump Station in Moorea, may also be considered.  Summer session, UC Extension and non-UC study abroad programs do not count towards this semester limit. Students approved for double majors or  simultaneous degrees in two colleges may be granted an additional semester. Rausser College does not limit the number of total units a student can accrue.</p> <h3>Senior Residence Requirement</h3> <p>Once you achieve and exceed 90 units (senior status), you must complete at least 24 of the remaining 30 units in residence at the Rausser College of Natural Resources over at least 2 semesters. To count as residence, a semester must consist of at least 6 passed units taken while the student is a member of Rausser. At least one of the two terms must be a fall or spring semester. Senior residence terms do not need to be completed consecutively. All courses offered on campus for the fall, spring, and summer terms by Berkeley departments and programs and all Berkeley online ('W') courses count. Inter-campus Visitor, Education Abroad Program, UC Berkeley Washington Program, and UC Berkeley Extension units do not count toward this requirement.  Students may use Summer Session to satisfy one semester of the Senior Residence Requirement, provided that 6 units of coursework are completed.</p> <h3>Modified Senior Residence Requirement</h3> <p>Participants in a fall, spring or summer UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP), Berkeley Summer Abroad, or the UC Berkeley Washington Program may meet a modified Senior Residence Requirement by completing 24 of their final 60 semester units in residence (excluding UCEAP). At least 12 of these 24 units must be completed after senior status is reached. International travel study programs sponsored by Summer Sessions and education abroad programs offered outside of the UC system do not qualify for modified senior residence.</p> <p>Most students automatically satisfy the residence requirement by attending classes here for four years. In general, there is no need to be concerned about this requirement, unless students go abroad for a semester or year or want to take courses at another institution or through University Extension during their senior year. In these cases, students should make an appointment to see an adviser to determine how they can meet the Senior Residence Requirement.</p> <h3>Grade Requirements</h3> <ul> 	<li>A 2.0 UC GPA is required for graduation.</li> 	<li>A 2.0 average in all upper division courses required of the major program is required for graduation.</li> 	<li>A grade of at least C- is required in all courses for the major.  Major and minor coursework taken in Spring 2020, Fall 2020, and Spring 2021 may be completed with P/NP grading option.  See more details below.</li> </ul> <h3><span id="docs-internal-guid-d18ac9d6-7fff-a2c9-bcde-b1106ed17aba">Changes in Policies and Procedures during the COVID-19 Pandemic</span></h3> <h5><span id="docs-internal-guid-d18ac9d6-7fff-a2c9-bcde-b1106ed17aba">Fall 2020, Spring 2021, SUMMER 2021 </span></h5> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-d18ac9d6-7fff-a2c9-bcde-b1106ed17aba">After much consultation across the colleges of UC Berkeley, and via our college Executive Committee, the following decisions have been made about the selection of the P/NP grade option (CPN) by undergraduate students during the </span>Fall 2020 &amp; Spring 2021 semesters for the Rausser College of Natural Resources.</p> <ul> 	<li> 	<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-d18ac9d6-7fff-a2c9-bcde-b1106ed17aba">College Course Requirements: </span>Reading and Composition, Quantitative Reasoning, and Foreign Language requirements normally satisfied with letter grades may be met with a passed (P) grade during the Fall 2020 semester.  This does not include the system-wide Entry Level Writing requirement.

				<a name="planofstudytext"></a><h2>Plan of Study</h2><p><span>These are sample program plans for completing the major in Molecular Environmental Biology. These plans assume that the student has completed the Entry Level Writing and American History and Institutions requirements prior to admission, and demonstrate completion of the major utilizing Fall and Spring semesters only. Most of the lower division major requirements and many of the upper division requirements are also offered during the summer terms. Students are strongly advised to work with peer and academic advisors to create a customized program plan specific to their situation. Your program plan will differ depending on previous credit received, your course schedule, and available offerings.</span></p>
<p><span>Students in Rausser College are required to take a minimum of 12 units each semester unless they are on an approved reduced course load. Students may need to take more than 12 units each semester, or may instead take course work in the summer, in order to reach the minimum 120 total semester units required for graduation depending on the number of units a student may have transferred in through exam credit or course work taken at other institutions. Please see the College Requirements tab on this page for additional details regarding unit requirements for graduation.</span></p>

<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-4f96e7ed-7fff-fcd6-873c-2ecd64032d3d">Molecular Environmental Biology (MEB) focuses on biological organisms and the hierarchy of life, from molecules and genes through cells, organisms, communities, and ecosystems. The breadth of this biological science program provides an important perspective for students who have a passion for biology and are interested in the application of biological principles to understand how organisms function in their environment. Also a pre-medical or pre-health science major, the discipline offers an array of six areas of concentration within biology: animal health and behavior, biodiversity, ecology, environmental and human health, </span>global change biology, and <span>insect biology/arthropod science. </span></p>

<h3>History of Art Major Program</h3>
<p>The Major in History of Art is designed to give students solid grounding in the artistic traditions, practices, and contexts that comprise historical and contemporary visuality. Equally, it introduces the discipline’s history, methods, and debates. It prepares students to do independent research, to evaluate evidence, to create coherent and sustained arguments, and to develop skills in academic writing. In a series of increasingly focused courses — lower division, upper division, seminar, and honors program — the major provides a format for students to learn how to analyze and interpret visual, material, and textual evidence from specific cultural settings and historical circumstances. Major requirements are also designed to maximize exposure to different historical periods, geographical regions, and topics while allowing flexibility for students to pursue specific interests by selecting a Focus of Study.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>To declare the major in the History of Art Department, a student must complete two courses taught in the department and receive a grade of C- or higher in each course. All subsequent courses a student wishes to apply to the major must also receive a grade of C- or higher. Once these prerequisites are met, students may formally petition to declare the major by making an appointment with an Undergraduate Adviser at any time during the fall and spring semesters. (Students in residence at UC Berkeley are strongly urged to complete all lower division requirements and one upper division course by the end of their sophomore year.) <strong>Transfer students should plan to take two History of Art courses in their first semester.</strong></p>
<p>Majors who declare early, especially in the sophomore year, enjoy several advantages:</p>
<p><span>1. A more thorough preparation for seminars and time to study more closely with several members of the faculty.</span></p>
<p>2. Greater flexibility in coordinating major requirements with College of Letters &amp; Science (L&amp;S) requirements and in planning a sequence of courses that allows for special courses or programs of study, e.g., study abroad, curatorial internships, independent study, a double-major, and the honors program.</p>
<p>3. Time for a generally higher level of study in the senior year, and opportunity to experiment with and prepare for diverse career opportunities.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Students with at least a 3.7 grade point average (GPA) in the History of Art major are eligible for admission into the honors program. Candidates for honors in History of Art are required to complete satisfactorily, within their senior year, an honors thesis consisting of at least two semesters of continuing academic work under faculty supervision (usually a seminar, directed research, or independent study course in the first semester plus, in the second semester, <span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="HISTART H195">HISTART H195</span></span>). Those who have completed the program will graduate with honors, high honors, or highest honors in the major depending upon their final GPA in all upper division courses taken to fulfill the major requirements. Please see the department's <a href="https://arthistory.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate/major-requirements/honors-awards/">honors program webpage</a> for further information.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The minor program in the History of Art Department is designed to provide a structured and broad program for those students majoring in other disciplines but with a strong interest in the history of art. For information regarding declaring the minor, please contact the department.</p>

<h3>Department Advising</h3>
<p>Declared majors must see an undergraduate adviser at least once each semester during the registration period (advisers are listed on the department website). These advising meetings provide majors with the opportunity to work closely with a faculty member who can help them develop an overall program of study well-suited to individual strengths and career goals. The advisers also apprise majors of special courses and opportunities, both in the History of Art Department and elsewhere. Please note that faculty advisers are typically not available during the summer and winter breaks. Advising appointments can be made by signing up <a href="https://arthistory.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate/welcome/" target="_blank">online.</a></p>
<p>In addition to general advising and coursework approval, advisers must approve all changes in registration, including withdrawals and add-drop changes, certain special study courses  (<span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="HISTART 193">HISTART 193</span> Directed Research</span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="HISTART 194">HISTART 194</span></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="HISTART H195">HISTART H195</span></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="HISTART C196W">HISTART C196W</span></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="HISTART 199">HISTART 199</span></span>), and some special programs. Appointments should be made well in advance of deadlines.</p>
<p>Each semester during the course enrollment period History of Art majors must see the undergraduate major adviser to discuss their program of study to release their advisor hold in order to gain access to the course enrollment system. Students should sign up for an advising appointment prior to their enrollment phase, having considered carefully the department’s course descriptions and having planned a schedule of proposed courses to be discussed with the adviser. Special additional office hours are held during enrollment periods, and advisers may decline to provide last-minute advising. Adviser holds will only be released over the phone or via email if a student is studying abroad or is physically incapacitated.</p>
<p>Department undergraduate advisers do not administer or approve coursework or degree requirements in the College of Letters &amp; Science other than the requirements of the major. For L&amp;S requirements, students should make an appointment to see an L&amp;S adviser in 206 Evans Hall.</p>
<h3>Suggestions for All Majors</h3>
<p>Foreign languages are not required in lower or upper division courses but a reading knowledge of European or Asian languages may be helpful in seminars and other research courses. Students planning on graduate study in the History of Art are urged to develop a reading knowledge of German and French or Italian as early as possible. Special language requirements pertain for graduate study in ancient and Asian art.</p>
<p>Recommended course load in History of Art will vary according to the student, course level, and individual course requirements. In general, no more than two History of Art courses per semester are recommended. A student’s final academic year may include a greater number of courses in History of Art, especially if all L&amp;S breadth requirements have been fulfilled.</p>
<p>Special programs, such as study abroad, internships, and double majoring require considerable advance planning. If you are interested in any of these, discuss your plans early with your adviser. Courses taken through study abroad must be discussed in advance with an adviser and will not be formally approved until after completion and until satisfactory documentation has been submitted. In order for courses taken abroad to satisfy major requirements, the breadth and depth of the course, the work demanded, and your performance must all meet Berkeley upper division standards. Your performance will be evaluated by a faculty adviser upon your return to campus to determine whether major requirements have been satisfied. Please see the department Study Abroad Information sheet.</p>
<p>Students with special intellectual or preprofessional interests may wish to enroll in independent study or research courses (<span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="HISTART 193">HISTART 193</span></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="HISTART 199">HISTART 199</span></span>), in a second seminar (192), or in additional, related courses in other departments. These students should discuss their interests with their advisers as early as possible.</p>
<h3>Letters of Recommendation</h3>
<p>Students should plan to request letters of recommendation from those faculty members with whom they have studied most closely, especially in seminars and other special study courses. General letters of reference for employment, internships, or graduate school/professional programs, may be placed on file with the <a href="https://career.berkeley.edu/Letter/Letter" target="_blank">Career Center</a> (2440 Bancroft Way).</p>
<h3>Graduate Study </h3>
<p>Students who anticipate applying to graduate schools should discuss their plans with their adviser or with the faculty member whose field most closely corresponds to their interests. If you plan to begin graduate study in the fall after your graduation from Berkeley, you will have to prepare applications in the fall of your senior year. Most schools have deadlines in December though February, especially if the application is made for both admission and fellowship support. Arrangements should also be made in the fall of your senior year for taking the Graduate Record Exam (GRE) or other graduate entrance exams that many schools require.</p>

<h3>Department and University Honors</h3>
<p><strong>Honors in Art History</strong>: Students with a 3.7 GPA in the major may complete and submit an honors thesis by enrolling in HA195 (4 units, graded). A student whose thesis receives a grade of A- or better will receive Departmental Honors (Honors, High Honors, or Highest Honors). The Honors Thesis is a two-semester project conducted under faculty supervision, as follows: a seminar, upper division lecture, directed research, or independent study course in the first semester, followed by HA195 in the second. For specific details regarding the Honors Program, students should speak with a faculty undergraduate advisor and read the <a href="https://arthistory.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate/major-requirements/honors-awards/">Guidelines for the Preparation of Theses</a>.</p>
<p><strong>University honors</strong><span> are awarded to students on the basis of overall GPA as follows: Distinction, High Distinction, and Highest Distinction (roughly equivalent to cum laude, magna cum laude, and summa cum laude). Requisite GPAs for University honors change each year. In 2016-2017 they were: Distinction: 3.724; High Distinction: 3.845; Highest Distinction: 3.947.</span></p>
<p><strong>Maybelle M. Toombs Awards </strong>recognize the potential talent and ability of students based upon their record in the major up to the beginning of the senior year. By that time, the students must have completed at least two semesters of coursework as a History of Art major at Berkeley. Criteria for the award are outstanding grade point average and receiving financial aid. The award carries a stipend payable in the student's senior year for research and travel.</p>
<p>For the <strong>Departmental Citation</strong>, presented at Commencement to a graduating senior, the Departmental Award Committee considers grades to be the principal criterion, but it also takes into account the character of the student's overall program, its ambition and depth; the student's ability to sustain a high level of excellence throughout his or her undergraduate work, from the freshman to the senior year, in the Art History Department as well as in other subjects; and the ways in which this broad experience is brought to bear in an honors thesis of high quality, one that notably demonstrates the ability to do research in the discipline and a genuine independence of mind and maturity of judgment.</p>
<h3>Brochures, Announcements, and Files </h3>
<p>Announcements and brochures on graduate study, internships, work experience, fellowships, study abroad, training programs, and special lectures and symposia are posted on the departmental bulletin board or distributed by email. If you are interested in a particular program and need more information, please contact the undergraduate student services adviser.</p>
<h3>Undergraduate Association</h3>
<p>The History of Art Undergraduate Student Association (H.Art) is an official campus group that exists to serve the interests of the department's majors. In the past, the association has compiled an internship directory, hosted a student-faculty brunch, sponsored special lunchtime talks with faculty and graduate students, and assisted in organizing career seminars. All majors are invited and encouraged to participate in the association. If you would like more information please leave a message in the association's mailbox in 416 Doe or speak with the undergraduate student services adviser. </p>

This course introduces students to the rich museum culture of London. Through lectures, seminars, and visits to museums we will explore how museums create histories of art, society, and national identity. The course draws on the approaches of several disciplines–art, social, and cultural history, anthropology, social geography, and critical theory–to interrogate the ways that museums reflect and shape what we know and how we see. Exploring a selection of</span><span class="deschide"> sites dating from the 18th century to the present day, we will consider the historical context in which these museums came about, the nature of their collections, and debates on current presentation, considering issues of museology, curatorial practice, and the construction of knowledge.</span><br/>

&quot;Extinction and Visual Culture” explores the evolutionary, planetary, and anthropogenic causes, processes, and events of biological extinction in relation to visual-material culture historically and in terms of mass extinction amid degradation of the biosphere and biodiversity loss. What does extinction look like, what is its material evidence? How do the visual arts, performance, and exhibition represent disappearance, absence, looming loss—and</span><span class="deschide"> address the grief and fear of extinction? What are extinction’s “visualities,” its social and political contexts and systems of visual expression and reception? Can visual images empower response to human ecological violence, help mitigate extinction?</span><br/>

This course is open to students with majors/interests in history, art history, law, anthropology, film studies, art practice, business, the sciences, and beyond. There is no prerequisite. It introduces the study of art not simply in terms of artists, periods, content, and style, but in relation to acts of looting/theft, iconoclasm/vandalism, and forgery—behaviors that seem contradictory to the importance of art in human culture. Global in its range, the course addresses</span><span class="deschide"> important episodes of taking, breaking, and faking from the ancient world to the present.

Rather than follow a master chronology that would attempt to contain Africa’s multiple cultural formations in a single narrative, this course will introduce students to African art through an investigation of a range of aesthetic traditions and movements across sub-Saharan Africa that are meaningfully reinvigorated in contemporary artistic production and popular visual culture. Our continual return to the cultural politics of the present</span><span class="deschide"> will provide an anchor and roadmap for our inquiry; we will see contemporary visual culture as staging interventions that push at Western ideas of “primitive African tradition,” while bringing to the fore conventions that, when tracked, reveal alternative traditions legible within an art historical context.</span><br/>

An introduction to the arts and visual culture of Latin America from the earliest monumental art traditions of prehistory to the present. The course is not a comprehensive survey of all traditions of art in Latin America, but rather a sampling of critical moments that is designed to serve as an introduction to this field of study.

Conversion often refers to changing religions. This process can be personal or historical, involve a single individual or entire groups, such as at the moment of colonization of the Americas, when thousands of indigenous people were forcibly or willingly converted to Christianity.

Does the converter become curious</span><span class="deschide"> about and affected by the beliefs of those he tries to gain over to his religion? What implications does this have for art, technology, thought?

This undergraduate semiar examines the resurgence of craft within contemporary art and theory. In a time when much art is outsourced--fabricated by large stables of assistants--what does it mean when artists return to traditional, and traditionally laborious, methods of handiwork such as knitting, ceramics, or woodworking? Our readings will consider historical and theoretical questions of process, materiality, skill, bodily effort, gendered</span><span class="deschide"> labor, and alternative economies of production.</span><br/>

This seminar investigates foundational principles of digital humanities though art history, cultural heritage and material preservation, with a particular focus on emerging threats to historic sites and objects. We will explore and engage with innovative technologies utilized to confront a variety of global challenges and provide ‘hands-on’ practical experience in laser scanning, photogrammetry, and digital mapping and much more. The seminar is thus a “journey”</span><span class="deschide"> of sorts, a dialogue with technology, art, materiality and historicities in an attempt to fully engage with cultural heritage issues through a twenty-first century lens. At the end of the semester, we will create an online portfolio/course website which showcases our work.</span><br/>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The mission of the Department of South and Southeast Asian Studies is to enable students to learn about the cultures and civilizations of South and Southeast Asia. The department teaches 13 languages and is an indispensable resource for programs in many other departments and areas.</p>
<p>For undergraduate majors, the department stresses an interdisciplinary approach and expects students to specialize in one of three areas—literature, religion, or cultural history. To this end, there are two tracks for majors—one that emphasizes the study of civilization and does not require language and one that requires the students to do four semesters of language work in addition to more general studies. UC Berkeley has an extraordinary number of experts in many areas of South and Southeast Asian Studies, and students are encouraged to take advantage of relevant courses in departments such as history, music, political science, ethnic studies, art history, linguistics, gender and women’s studies, and English. Qualified undergraduates are also encouraged to participate in graduate seminars.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<p>There are two tracks in the South and Southeast Asian Studies major—one that emphasizes the study of civilization and does not require language, and one that requires the students to do four semesters of language work in addition to more general studies. Within each track, students specialize in an area (South or Southeast Asia).</p>
<h4>Goals for the Language Track</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Students should have mastered the grammar (included complex grammatical features) of at least one South and Southeast Asian language (Sanskrit, Hindi, Tamil, Urdu, Punjabi, Bengali, Telugu for South Asia and Indonesian, Thai, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Khmer for Southeast). They should be able to read stories, newspapers, and the like in the modern language in which they specialize.</li>
	<li>They should be able to speak and get about using the language (if relevant) and to write simple prose in the modern language.</li>
	<li>For classic languages such as Sanskrit, students should have the basic facility in reading a variety of different genres in the original, and they should be comfortable using standard resource materials such as dictionaries, traditional grammars, and online resources. They are also expected to be able to engage critically with the pertinent secondary sources relevant to the texts being read.</li>
	<li>They should have a sound knowledge of one culture or area of South or Southeast Asia.</li>
	<li>They should have a broad general acquaintance with either South or Southeast Asia including a good knowledge of cultural history, literature, and/or religion.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Goals for the Civilization Track</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Students should have a thorough understanding of the histories and culture of either South or Southeast Asia.</li>
	<li>In lieu of acquiring detailed knowledge of one of the cultural/linguistic areas of South or Southeast Asia, they are expected to deepen their mastery of cultural history or religion of South or Southeast Asia.</li>
	<li>They should specialize in a particular national tradition and/or in a particular approach to the region (historical, literary, art, performative).</li>

The eleven nation-states that comprise the region of Southeast Asia are defined by their linguistic, cultural, economic, and sociopolitical diversity. One facet that plays a crucial role in binding this region is its environment.

poetic forms and textual traditions of 17 th  to 19 th  century Southeast Asia through a<br/>
comparative study of three epic poems:  Tum Teav (Cambodia), Khun Chang Khun<br/>
Phaen (Thailand), and Tale of Kieu (Vietnam).  We will explore the dynamics of desire<br/>
and transgression, duty and sacrifice, kinship and kingship, and the interplay between<br/>
folk, court, Buddhist</span><span class="deschide">, Confucian, and Hindu values.  Finally, we will consider the<br/>
contemporary currency and iconic status of these works in Southeast Asia and in<br/>
diaspora; what makes a national canon, and why these epic tales of love, loss and war,<br/>
remain strangers to the west.</span><br/>

This course is an advanced introduction to the major teachings of Indian Buddhism and their philosophical elaborations. We will cover the core tenets attributed to the Buddha, and the later doctrinal and scholastic developments that turned Buddhism into one of the principal philosophical traditions of India. For this we will read select primary sources—in principle, extracts of the scriptures and later treatises—and academic articles and</span><span class="deschide"> book chapters. Rather than offering a broad introductory survey of Buddhist traditions across space and time, this class is geared towards students who are already familiar with the basics of Buddhism and want to deepen their understanding of the principal teachings of Buddhism originating in India.</span><br/>

This course provides an overview of one of the world's largest and most beloved<br/>
film industries, the popular Hindi cinema produced in Bombay (Mumbai) and consumed around<br/>
the world under the label &quot;Bollywood.&quot; The films and readings range from the post-<br/>
Independence era to the present, with introduction to key films, directors, stars, genres, formal<br/>
techniques, and themes. Our readings and viewings allow us to question and discuss the</span><span class="deschide"> ways<br/>
these films reflect and influence the cultures and society from which they emerge. We shall<br/>
reflect on our own practices of spectatorship and how we consume and label non-western<br/>
cultures and culture industries. Together we'll develop a critical vocabulary to help us analyze<br/>
and critique Hindi cinema.</span><br/>

This course considers the co-option, reinterpretation and dissemination of sacred texts and religious practices in various political and cultural projects in India during the colonial and post-colonial periods. Students will be introduced to religious “reform” movements, cross-cultural debates during the colonial period, and how the concept of a secular state in post-Independence India has shaped and continues to shape religious practice and</span><span class="deschide"> public policy. Important themes include transformations in the role of women, debates around caste and “untouchability”, and religious conversions.

Students learn to read roadside signs, scholarly articles, and an entire Khmer novel. Topics include current events in Cambodia, Cambodian history and politics, and a basic overview of traditional Khmer literature. Much of this study will be accomplished by working on projects in groups with other students. One such project will involve the preparation and performance of a play based on sections of the modern Khmer novel students read in</span><span class="deschide"> this course. All students will design and carry out an independent research project on the topic of their choice (which will account for 30% of the final grade), and present their research at the end of the second semester to an audience of their peers, entirely in Khmer.</span><br/>

This course continues the themes and goals of 100B. Students will focus on the same broad topics covered in Intermediate Khmer--religion, traditional culture, and the language of public information (news and advertising)--but they will learn more advanced vocabulary and grammatical structures necessary for the discussion of these topics with educated native speakers, and read more advanced texts dealing with these topics than the Intermediate students.</span><span class="deschide"> Additional material beyond the Intermediate curriculum includes reading and analyzing historical folk tales, learning to discuss the rice-farming cycle, and acquiring the tools to discuss research and &quot;development&quot; work in Cambodia at a sophisticated level.</span><br/>

Students will read advanced texts dealing with the topics of politics and history. They will also gain exposure to traditional verse texts, and read, discuss, and undertake group projects based on a variety of modern Khmer short stories. As in the case with Intermediate Khmer, students will also undertake substantial independent study, culminating in a final oral presentation. However, the standard by which both written and oral material</span><span class="deschide"> will be judged will be much higher for Advanced students. Special attention will be paid to formal speaking style and advanced grammatical structures in Khmer for all students, and colloquial spoken expression for non-native speakers.</span><br/>

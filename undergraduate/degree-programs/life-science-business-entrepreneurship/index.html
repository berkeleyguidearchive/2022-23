Modern genetic contributions will be presented on such issues as genetic engineering of plants and animals, the emergence of new pathogens, the role of genetic variation among individuals, and the extent to which DNA is and</span><span class="deschide"> isn’t destiny. Each week will close with the presentation and discussion of a defining biological challenge facing the world.</span><br/>

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> The learning objectives will be, at one end, to understand what an experiment is, how is it controlled and what does one need to know about an experiment to be able to rely upon any conclusion. That is the fundamental issue in all science, and is frequently overlooked in many media accounts of science. A second objective is to learn enough of the language of biology to be able to ask the kind of informed questions that we would want all elected representatives to pay attention to. A third objective is for students to cultivate confidence that through non-specialized information sources they can become informed consumers of contemporary scientific thought, and to develop those habits of intellect to think about evidence in a scientific manner. A fourth objective is for students to enjoy the abundance of high quality books, articles and multimedia that will enable a lifetime of discovery outside the structure of a college course.<br/></p></div>

Advances in neuroscience are forcing us to confront anew questions concerning the nature of identity, reality, morality, and free will. Scientists can now implant artificial memories, augment natural brain capabilities, and read out intentions from the brain before they are acted upon. This class intends to shine a light on the brave new world enabled by modern neuroscience through three lenses: science, film, and philosophy. Topics to be covered include: the architecture</span><span class="deschide"> of the brain, AI &amp; the mind body problem, the neural construction of reality, action and free will, memory, the neural basis of morality, mechanisms for brain wiring, mental illness, and brain machine interfaces.</span><br/>

The overarching goal of MCB 153 is to inform our MCB majors how therapeutics are developed and created. After completing this course, students will have a firm understanding on the mechanism of action of several therapies used to fight disease. The course will cover areas such as the discovery and refinement of antibiotics, anti-virals, cancer therapies, CRISPR0-based therapies. Furthermore, MCB 153 will delve into disease areas not covered in</span><span class="deschide"> other courses, such as autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular diseases and neurological disease. Lastly, MCB 153 will implement a “case study” for each topic displaying real world challenges and solutions to treating complex diseases.</span><br/>

The goal of this connector course is to provide an understanding of how data and statistical analysis can improve managerial decision-making. We will explore statistical methods for gleaning insights from economic and social data, with an emphasis on approaches to identifying causal relationships. We will discuss how to design and analyze randomized experiments and introduce econometric methods for estimating causal effects in non-experimental</span><span class="deschide"> data. The course draws on a variety of business and social science applications, including advertising, management, online marketplaces, labor markets, and education.

The course is designed to cover advanced corporate finance issues. Its purpose is two-fold. First, it will help students develop a tool-box, both conceptual and quantitative, to address real-world corporate financial issues that they will likely use immediately in any finance-related career.

Energy is one of the main drivers of civilization. Today we are at the precipice of what many hope will be a major paradigm shift in energy production and use. Two transitions are needed. On the one hand, we must find ways to extend the benefits of our existing energy system to the impoverished people living in the developing world while continuing to provide these benefits to the people of the developed world. On the other hand, we must completely</span><span class="deschide"> overhaul the existing system to fight climate change and other forms of air and water pollution. Are these shifts truly within our reach? Can we achieve both simultaneously? If so, how?

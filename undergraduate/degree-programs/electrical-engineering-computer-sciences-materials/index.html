				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The joint major programs are designed for students who wish to undertake study in two areas of engineering in order to qualify for employment in either field or for positions in which competence in two fields is required. These curricula include the core courses in each of the major fields. While they require slightly increased course loads, they can be completed in four years. Both majors are shown on the student's transcript of record.</p>
<p>For students interested in materials and devices, a joint major in electrical engineering and computer sciences (EECS)/materials science and engineering (MSE) can be valuable. The program combines the study of materials from a broad perspective, as taught in MSE, with the study of their applications in electronic devices and circuits, as taught in EECS.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Joint Major</h3>
<p>Admission directly to a joint major is closed to freshmen and junior transfer applicants. Students interested in a joint program may apply to change majors during specific times in their academic progress. Please see the <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/majors-minors/joint-majors">College of Engineering joint majors website</a> for complete details.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/majors-minors/joint-majors" target="_blank">Visit Program Website</a></p>

				<a name="fiveyearbsmstext"></a><h2>Five-Year BS/MS</h2><p>This program is geared toward students who would like to pursue an education beyond the BS/BA, allowing them to achieve greater breadth and depth of knowledge and do some research. It is not intended for students who have definitely decided to pursue a PhD immediately following graduation. Those students are advised to apply for a PhD program at Berkeley or elsewhere during their senior year. Students who have been accepted into the five-year BA/MS or BS/MS are free to change their minds later and apply to enter the PhD program or apply to a PhD program at another university. Their subsequent admission to the PhD program is competitive with our other PhD applicants.</p>
<p>The program is focused on interdisciplinary training at a graduate level; with at least 8 units of course work outside EECS required. Students will emerge as leaders in their technical and professional fields.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Program is focused on interdisciplinary study and more experience in aligned technical fields such as physics, materials science, statistics, biology, etc., and/or professional disciplines such as management of technology, business law, and public policy.</li>
	<li>Participants, if admitted to the program,  must begin the graduate portion in the semester immediately following the conferral of their bachelor's degree.</li>
	<li>Participation in the program is permitted for only one additional year (two semesters) beyond the bachelor's degree.</li>
	<li>Participation is only available to Berkeley EECS and L&amp;S CS undergraduates.</li>
	<li>Participants in program are self-funded.</li>
	<li>Participants in program may serve as Graduate Student Instructors with the approval of their faculty research advisor and the 5th Year MS Committee.</li>
</ul>
<p>For further information regarding this program, please see the <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/FiveYearMS/" target="_blank">Department's website</a></p>
<h1><strong>Materials Science and Engineering Five-Year BS/MS</strong></h1>
<p>The five-year combined Bachelor of Science/Master of Science program augments the existing four-year undergraduate program with a fifth year of graduate study that provides a professionally-oriented component, preparing students for careers in engineering or engineering management within the business, government, and/or industrial sectors. In this program, students earn a bachelor's degree and subsequently, a Master of Science degree under Plan II (without thesis) of the Academic Senate. This five-year program emphasizes interdisciplinary study through an independent project coupled to coursework. The program is open to undergraduate Materials Science and Engineering majors (both single or joint majors) only. </p>
<p>Unit Requirements (minimum 24 units)</p>
<ul>
	<li>At least 12 units must be graduate units in major subject (200+ level)</li>
	<li>Individual study or research
	<ul>
		<li>At least 1 unit/semester (2 units total)</li>
		<li>No more than 2 units/semester (4 units total)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Remaining 12 units may be letter graded upper-division or graduate courses approve by major field advisor.</li>
	<li>A grade of B or better in three of five core course categories (thermodynamics, structure or phase transformations, characterization, processing and properties) at the 200+ level</li>
	<li>Minimum 3.0 GPA must be maintained</li>
	<li>Each course may only satisfy one category</li>
	<li>An independent project will be performed as part of a required two course sequence, MSE 296A&amp;B, under the supervision of a faculty member. Students are encouraged to identify faculty supervisors as soon as possible, but by no later than the beginning of the ninth semester. Students will be required to complete both a project report and an oral presentation.</li>

Entering junior transfers are allowed five semesters to complete their degree requirements. Summer terms are optional and do not count toward the maximum. Students are responsible for planning and satisfactorily completing all graduation requirements within the maximum allowable semesters. </li> 	<li>Adhere to all <a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-guide/policies-procedures/" target="_blank">college policies and procedures </a>as they complete degree requirements.</li> 	<li>Complete the lower division program before enrolling in upper division engineering courses. </li> </ol> <h3><strong>Humanities and Social Sciences (H/SS) Requirement</strong></h3> <p style="margin-left:22.5pt">To promote a rich and varied educational experience outside of the technical requirements for each major, the College of Engineering has a six-course <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/student-services/degree-requirements/humanities-and-social-sciences" target="_blank">Humanities and Social Sciences breadth requirement</a>, which must be completed to graduate. This requirement, built into all the engineering programs of study, includes two Reading and Composition courses (R&amp;C), and four additional courses within which a number of specific conditions must be satisfied. See the <a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-guide/degree-requirements/humanities-and-social-sciences/" target="_blank">humanities and social sciences</a> section of our website for details.</p> <h3><strong>Class Schedule Requirements</strong></h3> <ul> 	<li>Minimum units per semester: 12.0</li> 	<li>Maximum units per semester:  20.5</li> 	<li>Minimum technical courses: College of Engineering undergraduates must include at least two letter graded technical courses (of at least 3 units each) in their semester program. Every semester students are expected to make satisfactory progress in their declared major. Satisfactory progress is determined by the student's Engineering Student Services Advisor. (Note: For most majors, <a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-guide/policies-procedures/scholarship-progress#ac12282" target="_blank">normal progress</a> will require enrolling in 3-4 technical courses each semester). Students who are not in compliance with this policy by the end of the fifth week of the semester are subject to a registration block that will delay enrollment for the following semester. </li> 	<li>All technical courses (math, science, engineering) that satisfy requirements for the major must be taken on a letter-graded basis (unless only offered as P/NP).</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Minimum Academic (Grade) Requirements</strong></h3> <ul> 	<li>Minimum overall and semester grade point averages of 2.00 (C average) are required of engineering undergraduates. Students will be subject to dismissal from the University if during any fall or spring semester their overall UC GPA falls below a 2.00, or their semester GPA is less than 2.00. </li> 	<li>Students must achieve a minimum grade point average of 2.00 (C average) in upper division technical courses required for the major curriculum each semester.</li> 	<li>A minimum overall grade point average of 2.00 and a minimum 2.00 grade point average in upper division technical course work required for the major are required to earn a Bachelor of Science in the College of Engineering.</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Unit Requirements</strong></h3> <p>To earn a Bachelor of Science in Engineering, students must complete at least 120 semester units of courses subject to certain guidelines:</p> <ul> 	<li>Completion of the requirements of one engineering<a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-guide/degree-requirements/major-programs/" target="_blank"> major program</a> of study. </li> 	<li>A maximum of 16 units of special studies coursework (courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, 198, or 199) is allowed to count towards the B.S. degree, and no more than 4 units in any single term can be counted.</li> 	<li>A maximum of 4 units of physical education from any school attended will count towards the 120 units.</li> 	<li> 	<p>Passed (P) grades may account for no more than one third of the total units completed at UC Berkeley, Fall Program for Freshmen (FPF), UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP), or UC Berkeley Washington Program (UCDC) toward the 120 overall minimum unit requirement. <span>Transfer credit is not factored into the limit. This includes transfer units from outside of the UC system, other UC campuses, credit-bearing exams, as well as UC Berkeley Extension XB units.</span></p> 	</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Normal Progress</strong></h3> <p>Students in the College of Engineering must enroll in a full-time program and make <a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-guide/policies-procedures/scholarship-progress/#ac12282" target="_blank">normal progress</a> each semester toward the bachelor's degree. The continued enrollment of students who fail to achieve minimum academic progress shall be subject to the approval of the dean. (Note: Students with official accommodations established by the Disabled Students' Program, with health or family issues, or with other reasons deemed appropriate by the dean may petition for an exception to normal progress rules.) </p>

This is a lab course that covers the design of modern Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). The labs lay the foundation of modern digital design by first setting-up the scripting and hardware description language base for specification of digital systems and interactions with tool flows. Software testing of digital designs is covered leading into a set of labs that cover the design flow. Digital synthesis, floorplanning, placement and routing are covered</span><span class="deschide">, as well as tools to evaluate design timing and power. Chip-level assembly is covered, instantiation of custom IP blocks: I/O pads, memories, PLLs, etc. The labs culminate with a project design – implementation of a 3-stage RISC-V processor with register file and caches.</span><br/>

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> The course is separated into four parts spanning the principles of synthetic materials and surfaces, principles of biological materials, biological performance of materials and devices, and state-of-the-art materials design. Students are required to attend class and master the material therein. In addition, readings from the clinical, life and materials science literature are assigned. Students are encouraged to seek out additional reference material to complement the readings assigned. A mid-term examination is given on basic principles (parts 1 and 2 of the outline). A comprehensive final examination is given as well. <br/>The purpose of this course is to introduce students to problems associated with the selection and function of biomaterials. Through class lectures and readings in both the physical and life science literature, students will gain broad knowledge of the criteria used to select biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance. Materials used in devices for medicine, dentistry, tissue engineering, drug delivery, and the biotechnology industry will be addressed.<br/>
<br/>This course also has a significant design component (~35%). Students will form small teams (five or less) and undertake a semester-long design project related to the subject matter of the course. The project includes the preparation of a paper and a 20 minute oral presentation critically analyzing a current material-tissue or material-solution problem. Students will be expected to design improvements to materials and devices to overcome the problems identified in class with existing materials.<br/></p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> <br/>
Apply math, science &amp; engineering principles to the understanding of soft materials, surface chemistry, DLVO theory, protein adsorption kinetics, viscoelasticity, mass diffusion, and molecular (i.e., drug) delivery kinetics.<br/>
<br/>
•<br/>
Design experiments and analyze data from the literature in the context of the class design project.<br/>
Apply core concepts in materials science to solve engineering problems related to the selection biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance.<br/>
Develop an understanding of the social, safety and medical consequences of biomaterial use and regulatory issues associated with the selection of biomaterials in the context of the silicone breast implant controversy and subsequent biomaterials crisis.<br/>
Work independently and function on a team, and develop solid communication skills (oral, graphic &amp; written) through the class design project.<br/>
•<br/>
Understanding of the origin of surface forces and interfacial free energy, and how they contribute to the development of the biomaterial interface and ultimately biomaterial performance.<br/></p></div>

<![CDATA[
<p>All human activity takes place on a geographic stage of great diversity and constant transformation. For more than a century, the Geography Department at Berkeley has been a leading center of scholarship about earth’s landscapes and human relationships to the environment. Our inquiries encompass a wide range of topics, from the economies and cultures of cities and built landscapes, to tropical climates and the flow of polar ice sheets. We combine rigorous empirical work with deeply conceptual theoretical analyses, always recognizing the importance of both spatial processes and accumulated histories. We use geographic analyses to illuminate the abiding problems of the modern world.</p>
<p>UC Berkeley's Geography Department provides a broad-ranging perspective on humans as inhabitants and transformers of the face of the earth. The search for this kind of understanding involves thorough study of (a) the interlocking systems of the natural environment (climate, landforms, oceans, biota) and the evaluation of natural resources; (b) those diverse historical, cultural, social, economic, and political structures and processes which affect the location and spatial organization of population groups and their activities; and (c) significant geographical units, whether described as cities, regions, nations, states or landscapes, where integrated interpretation can be attempted, and a variety of problems thereby better understood.</p>
<p>As geographic theory and research has expanded their horizons over the past quarter-century, five research focuses have emerged to define Geography at Berkeley: </p>
<p class="introtext"><a href="https://geography.berkeley.edu/news/research/earth-system-science" target="_blank"><strong>Earth System Science</strong></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Earth System Science is the study of the interconnected components of our environment—the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, cryosphere, and biosphere—and how they interact to produce an integrated whole. It utilizes the fundamental disciplines of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology and applies them in the context of human activities and landscapes to understand the Earth, at scales ranging from single watersheds to the entire globe. The complex system of interactions is investigated to address questions about current and future sustainability, how environmental changes affect society, and how society influences the environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="introtext"><a href="https://geography.berkeley.edu/news/research/racial-geographies" target="_blank"><span><strong>Racial Geographies</strong></span></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Racial Geographies represents an insurgent geography that critically engages with questions of race, drawing from, and contributing to, an intellectual history rooted in anti-racist and anti-colonial struggles. We are concerned with how geography is explicitly and implicitly implicated in the construction and deconstruction of race and its symptoms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="introtext"><a href="https://geography.berkeley.edu/news/research/critical-environments" target="_blank"><span><strong>Critical Environments</strong></span></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Critical Environments attends to the complex relations that constitute the material and social dimensions of the modern world. We explore lives and ecologies that emerge together with histories of capitalism, militarism, racism, colonialism, and sexuality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="introtext"><a href="https://geography.berkeley.edu/news/research/geospatial-representation" target="_blank"><strong>Geospatial Representation</strong></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How peoples and cultures represent space and time are central to understanding the world, shaping the possibilities - and the limits - of our thinking, knowing, and being. We work towards cross-cultural geospatial representations in service to understanding and collaboration across communities. We also encourage antiracist and anticolonial geospatial representation in the service of planetary decolonization, to literally remake the maps and other representational forms that reinforce our divided planet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="introtext"><a href="https://geography.berkeley.edu/news/research/political-economies" target="_blank"><strong>Political Economies</strong></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Political Economies cuts across metropolitan and Global South/ postcolonial perspectives on contemporary questions concerning capitalist and imperialist dynamics. Berkeley Geography explores political-economic processes through urban, agrarian, and oceanic studies, emphasizing the dynamics of past, present, and future. Berkeley Geography interrogates capitalism, as well as its articulations with other forms of value and devaluation of places and people, through racial, gendered, sexual, and colonial relations. Berkeley Geography also explores human-environment relations and questions concerning social natures and political-ecological processes through the lens of critical political economy.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="tglhead"><strong>Bachelor of Arts in Geography</strong></h3>
<p>UC Berkeley's Geography B.A. is unusually broad and diverse, including the study of cultural, economic, political, historical, biophysical, urban and regional geography as well as cartography, quantitative methods, Geographical Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing and fieldwork. Backgrounds in the natural and social sciences, history, and statistical methods may be useful to the Geography major, with the mix and emphasis depending on the student's particular interests. Completing a major in Geography requires the satisfactory completion of three lower-division courses and eight upper-division courses. Lower-division requirements ensure that all students gain a broad understanding of the discipline, while upper-division requirements are structured to allow students to specialize in the areas of their greatest interest.</p>
<p>Geography students are expected to have diverse interests and independent thought. The department welcomes students from a variety of backgrounds, including those with professional experience who wish to deepen their education. Students are encouraged to roam freely through the curriculum and to follow their inspiration where it leads while working in tandem with faculty and staff advisers. </p>

<![CDATA[
<h3 class="tglhead"><strong>Declaring the Major</strong></h3>
<p>Students may declare the Geography major after completing at least 30 units with a 2.0 or better cumulative UC Berkeley GPA and after completing at least two of the three lower-division requirements. Junior transfer students should declare their major during the beginning of their second semester at UC Berkeley. Students are able to use community college coursework as substitutions for lower-division requirements with approval from the Undergraduate Major Advisor.</p>
<p>To declare a major in Geography, please <a href="https://calendly.com/geography/individual" target="_blank">schedule an appointment</a> with the Undergraduate Major Advisor, Ambrosia Shapiro.</p>
<p>The major requires students to take <strong>three lower-division courses</strong>, one in each of these areas:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Basic Physical Geography</li>
	<li>World Geography</li>
	<li>Regional Geography</li>
</ul>

The intersection of nature, identity, and politics pepper the pages of newspapers almost every day from stories of toxic waste sites, crime, genetic engineering to indigenous struggles, and terrorist tendencies. In all these and many other cases, ideas of race, class, and gender intersect with ideas of nature and geography in often tenacious and troubling ways. Our approach will be to understand these traditional ideas</span><span class="deschide"> of environmental justice as well as to examine less traditional sites of environmental justice such as the laboratory, the war zone, the urban mall, and the courtroom.</span><br/>

In this course, students will observe and analyze how the American city has been built, experienced, imagined, and transformed. Using recent scholarship and primary sources, we will track the historical evolution of the city and assess change and continuity in major themes of urban life: race, gender, and difference, industry and labor, community and culture, and power and politics. These themes become increasingly</span><span class="deschide"> intertwined throughout the course.

This course examines the distinct but ill-defined San Francisco Bay Area. Our approach will be neither to simply learn about the individual places that compose the Bay Area nor to study a succession of detached periods of development. Instead, we will think critically about the creations, contestations, and transformations of Bay Area spaces—landscapes, communities, neighborhoods, cities, suburbs, and</span><span class="deschide"> the metropolitan region. Topics include indigenous geographies, colonialism, industrialization and economic geography, cities and suburbs, gentrification and displacement, regional racial formation and place-based identities, and resistance and rebellion.</span><br/>

Since the late 1990s, Oakland has experienced considerable racial and economic restructuring. Oakland’s formerly prominent Black population has dwindled precipitously, as the city lost nearly 25% of its Black population since 2010. Cultural institutions, like churches, barbershops, blues clubs, and restaurants that once served its vast working-class population were replaced by trendy shops and hipster outlets. Students will engage the sense of</span><span class="deschide"> loss and possibility arising in the city as they participate in a series of in-class workshops to learn various field methods. They will also work in neighborhoods with community leaders and groups to document residents’ valued places and how these places have changed over time.<br/></span><br/>

Black Geographies considers the concept of geography to examine multiple orientations through engaging critical race, black feminist, diaspora and queer studies. The course covers approaches to the geographical categorization of blackness through two organizing frameworks. The first, the ‘black geographic,’ ‘geography’ serves as a productive analytic for examining the lived experiences, conceptual limits, and theoretical purchase of blackness through the reading</span><span class="deschide"> of some seminal and contemporary texts by black geographers. The second, ‘geographic blackness,’ considers how blackness as a modality of analysis gives insight and shape to the discipline of geography through texts by non-geographers that engage or invoke geographic themes.</span><br/>

This course surveys the historical relationship between fossil fuels and the capitalist economy. Beginning with the origin of intensive fossil fuel use in the early modern world, and then moving through the industrial epochs of coal and then oil, this course asks how have fossil fuels shaped the trajectory of our modern economic world? Students will investigate the broad, structural</span><span class="deschide"> impact these resources have had on labor relations, economic development, culture, the environment, politics, and more. Framed around the current, contested transition off of coal, oil, and gas, this course also asks what the future of fossil fuels look like. Will we disentangle ourselves from these sources of energy – what does the future hold?</span><br/>

Familiarize students with debates about the relationship of energy to the origin of capitalism. Develop students’ understanding of the complex impacts of the advent of both coal and oil. Promote a fundamental understanding of how these resources are extracted, and the conflicts and difficulties surrounding their production. Introduce students to theoretical debates about resource crises that developed in the 1970s. Examine, in detail, the conflict today to end fossil fuels: the barriers in the way, the political actors involved, and the economic complexities of the transition. Students will also participate in a short research project that will encourage source-finding, thesis development, and relational thinking across disciplines.<br/></p></div>

This course examines the fundamentally geographic nature of our current, historically unique system of material reproduction—capitalism—and how capitalist logics have shaped places and forms of life over the course of the system’s growth and change. We will explore how capitalist processes shape the rise (and inevitable fall) of places, techniques, social worlds, and divisions of labor, and pay close attention to the power relations and spatial</span><span class="deschide"> organization that accompany them. The course provides a grounding in critical perspectives such as the Marxian, Black radical, and feminist traditions to equip students with theoretical tools to understand and interpret the spatiality of contemporary capitalism.</span><br/>

Postcolonial studies focus on how processes of colonialism/imperialism continue even after the formal dissolution of empire. A central argument of this course is that critical human geography can make important contributions to understanding the interconnections between forces at play in different parts of the world. Drawing on concepts of space, place, culture, power, and difference, its purpose is to provide a set of tools for grappling with</span><span class="deschide"> the conditions in which we find ourselves, and for thinking about the possibilities for social change.</span><br/>

How does the chemical makeup of Earth make it suitable for life? And how does life in turn alter the chemistry of our planet? Biogeochemistry is the field of science that explores the imprint of biota (including humans) on the chemistry of the ocean, land and atmosphere. This interdisciplinary field addresses global problems, including climate change feedbacks, air quality, land use change, and marine ecosystem health. We will provide an overview</span><span class="deschide"> of the major biogeochemical cycles, discuss the biogeochemistry of major ecosystems, and introduce the major biogeochemical questions being asked today.

Through class discussions and homework assignments students will learn of historic climate catastrophes, how different societies have responded and what we can learn from these responses in terms of building climate resilience. We will go through simplified physical processes associated with recent climate events and delve into the details of how they occur and to what extent climate extremes are trending. One of the important learning objectives is to provide dual learning, that is, I propose to offer upper level undergraduates that lack sufficient mathematics and physics, while at the same provide graduate students and atmospheric science/statistics undergraduates a detailed understanding of climate impacts and risks. Graduate students have an augmented set of homework problems.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> An expected learning outcome is the ability to articulate climate risk with clear descriptions of mechanisms of change, degree and likelihood of impacts and methods of risk reduction. This class and Climates of the World will essentially be a two-semester sequence that (1) introduces students to the basic concepts of meteorology, climate change, climate extremes and (2) the types of risks and strategies that are currently being implemented and are in planning stages.</p></div>

What is America as a landscape and a place, and how do we know it when we see it? This course seeks to address such questions, to introduce ways of seeing and interpreting American histories and cultures, as revealed in everyday built surroundings—homes, highways, farms, factories, stores, recreation areas, small towns, city districts, and regions. It does so through the lens of cultural geography, an interdisciplinary practice that developed, in part, here</span><span class="deschide"> at Berkeley. Our goal in this course is thus twofold: First, to develop literacy in the role of space and place in American culture, and second to develop a working knowledge of cultural geography as a practice.</span><br/>

A spatial analytic approach to digital mapping and GIS. Given that recording the geolocation of scientific, business and social data is now routine, the question of what we can learn from the spatial aspect of data arises. This class looks at challenges in analyzing spatial data, particularly scale and spatial dependence. Various methods are considered such as hotspot detection, interpolation, and map overlay.

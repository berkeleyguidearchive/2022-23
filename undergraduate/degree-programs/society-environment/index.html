				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>Social and environmental problems are deeply intertwined. This major introduces students to the main approaches and theory for environmental social sciences including how social science tools can be applied to environmental problems and how social science theories contribute to understanding environmental problems. At the upper-division level, there are three major areas of concentration. Students are exposed to all three areas and choose to focus on one: US Environmental Policy and Management, Global Environmental Politics, or Justice and Sustainability.</p>
<p>Society and Environment graduates are well-prepared for careers in fields such as environmental consulting, education, health, or law; community, urban, or regional planning; and other related areas of environmentalism in public agencies, nonprofit conservation organizations, and private companies. Graduates are well-qualified for a variety of graduate programs, including law school.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Advice on admission for freshmen and transfer students can be found on the <a href="/2022-23/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/#admissionstext" target="_blank">Rausser College of Natural Resources Admissions Guide</a> page or the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/prospective-students" target="_blank">Prospective Student website</a>. Freshman students may apply directly to the major, or they may select the Rausser College undeclared option and declare the major by the end of their fourth semester. Transfer students may apply directly to the major through the UC application.</p>
<p>Information for current Berkeley students who would like to declare the major after admission, including information on a change of major or change of college, please see chapter 6 of the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">Rausser College Undergraduate Student Handbook</a><a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook">.</a></p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Students with a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.6 or higher may enroll in the Rausser College of Natural Resources honors program (H196) once they have reached upper-division standing. To fulfill the program requirements, students design, conduct, and report on an individual research project working with a faculty sponsor. For further information on the honors program, please see the Rausser website, <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/honors" target="_blank">https://nature.berkeley.edu/honors</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>There is no minor program in Society and Environment.</p>

				<a name="collegerequirementstext"></a><h2>College Requirements</h2> <p><a href="/2022-23/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/reading-composition-requirement/">Reading and Composition</a></p> <p>In order to provide a solid foundation in reading, writing and critical thinking all majors in the College require two semesters of lower division work in composition. Students must complete a first-level reading and composition course by the end of their second semester and a second-level course by the end of their fourth semester.</p> <p><a href="/2022-23/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/foreign-language-requirement/">Foreign Language</a>: <strong>EEP Majors only</strong></p> <p>The Foreign Language requirement is only required by Environmental Economics and Policy (EEP) majors. It may be satisfied by demonstrating proficiency in reading comprehension, writing, and conversation in a foreign language equivalent to the second semester college level, either by passing an exam or by completing approved course work.</p> <p><a href="/2022-23/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/quantitative-reasoning-requirement/">Quantitative Reasoning</a>: <strong>EEP Majors only</strong></p> <p>The Quantitative Reasoning requirement is only required by Environmental Economics and Policy (EEP) majors. The requirement may be satisfied by exam or by taking an approved course.</p> <h3>Undergraduate Breadth</h3> <p>Undergraduate breadth provide Berkeley students with a rich and varied educational experience outside of their major program and many students complete their breadth courses in their first two years. Breadth courses are built into the Rausser College major requirements and each major requires a different number of breath courses and categories. The EEP major is the only college major that requires the entire 7 course breadth. Refer to the major snapshots on each <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/majors-minors" target="_blank">Rausser College major page</a> for additional information. </p> <h3>High School Exam Credit</h3> <p>Rausser College students may apply high school exam credit (Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, A-Level Exam) towards many College and Major Requirements. See <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/courses-grades#AP%20Exam%20Equivalency%20Chat" target="_blank">AP Exam Equivalency Chart and Higher Level IB Exam Equivalency Chart</a> in the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">Rausser College Student Handbook</a> for more information.</p> <h3>Unit Requirements</h3> <p>Students must complete at least 120 semester units of courses subject to certain guidelines:</p> <ul> 	<li>At least 36 units must be upper division courses, including a minimum of 15 units of upper division courses in the Rausser College. </li> 	<li>A maximum of 16 units of Special Studies coursework (courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, 198, or 199) is allowed towards the 120 units; a maximum of four is allowed in a given semester.</li> 	<li>A maximum of 4 units of Physical Education from any school attended will count towards the 120 units.</li> 	<li>Students may receive unit credit for courses graded P (including P/NP units taken through EAP) up to a limit of one-third of the total units taken and passed on the Berkeley campus at the time of graduation.  Courses taken for P/NP in the Spring 2020 semester will not count toward this limit.</li> </ul> <h4>Semester Unit Minimum</h4> <p>All Rausser College students must enroll in at least 12 units each fall and spring semester.</p> <h4>Semester Unit Maximum</h4> <p>To request permission to take more than 20.5 units in a semester, please see the major adviser.</p> <h3>Semester Limit</h3> <p>Students admitted as freshmen must graduate within 8 fall/spring semesters at UC Berkeley. Students admitted as transfer students must graduate within 4 fall/spring semesters at UC Berkeley. Students who go on EAP and UCDC can petition for additional semesters. Other UC-affiliated programs, such as the Gump Station in Moorea, may also be considered.  Summer session, UC Extension and non-UC study abroad programs do not count towards this semester limit. Students approved for double majors or  simultaneous degrees in two colleges may be granted an additional semester. Rausser College does not limit the number of total units a student can accrue.</p> <h3>Senior Residence Requirement</h3> <p>Once you achieve and exceed 90 units (senior status), you must complete at least 24 of the remaining 30 units in residence at the Rausser College of Natural Resources over at least 2 semesters. To count as residence, a semester must consist of at least 6 passed units taken while the student is a member of Rausser. At least one of the two terms must be a fall or spring semester. Senior residence terms do not need to be completed consecutively. All courses offered on campus for the fall, spring, and summer terms by Berkeley departments and programs and all Berkeley online ('W') courses count. Inter-campus Visitor, Education Abroad Program, UC Berkeley Washington Program, and UC Berkeley Extension units do not count toward this requirement.  Students may use Summer Session to satisfy one semester of the Senior Residence Requirement, provided that 6 units of coursework are completed.</p> <h3>Modified Senior Residence Requirement</h3> <p>Participants in a fall, spring or summer UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP), Berkeley Summer Abroad, or the UC Berkeley Washington Program may meet a modified Senior Residence Requirement by completing 24 of their final 60 semester units in residence (excluding UCEAP). At least 12 of these 24 units must be completed after senior status is reached. International travel study programs sponsored by Summer Sessions and education abroad programs offered outside of the UC system do not qualify for modified senior residence.</p> <p>Most students automatically satisfy the residence requirement by attending classes here for four years. In general, there is no need to be concerned about this requirement, unless students go abroad for a semester or year or want to take courses at another institution or through University Extension during their senior year.

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<p>The Society and Environment major develops students’ capacities to theorize, analyze, interpret and influence social causes and consequences of environmental problems.</p>
<p>Society and Environment graduates gain an understanding of the complex interactions between social, technological, and natural systems—conceptually, analytically, operationally, and articulately—for their individually chosen environmental problems and solutions. Graduates do the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Learn about social processes that affect environmental equity, productivity, and stability for diverse peoples and generations</li>
	<li>Form and link institutions of science, industry, technology, resource use, and societal governance</li>
	<li>Work across the operational scales of environmental management and policy from the local to global</li>
	<li>Shape operational responses, in policy and practice, to problems of environmental injustice, sustainability, and productivity</li>
</ul>
<p>Graduates are expected to play effective and credible roles in the public, professional, and scientific arenas in which they choose to work. These arenas include, for example, the politics, policy, and management of urban, agricultural, forest, land, and water systems and the particular sets of socioeconomic, scientific, industrial, and governmental institutions these engage.</p>

From interactive web maps to spatial data analysis, digital geographic data and information are becoming an important part of the data science landscape. Almost everything happens somewhere that can be mapped on the surface of the earth. In many cases the where matters as much to an analysis as the what and the why. Geospatial data analysis allows a researcher to consider location explicitly. This course provides an introduction to working with digital</span><span class="deschide"> geographic data, or geospatial data. We will explore concepts of geospatial data representation, methods for acquisition, processing and analysis, and techniques for creating compelling geovisualizations. No prior knowledge is assumed or expected.<br/></span><br/>

Communication is central to the lives of most, if not all animals. How and why animals communicate is thus central to understanding the ecology, behavior, neurobiology, and evolution of animal systems. This course will focus on understanding the basic principles driving the communication system of a species, drawing together topics ranging from the physical properties of the environment, physiology of sensory systems, animal behavior and</span><span class="deschide"> ecology, using examples from classic and recent publications.</span><br/>

Animals have long been the subject of human inquiry. As historian Harriet Ritvo writes, “Learned attention to the animal is far from new.&quot; However, in recent decades social movements, artists, and scholars have focused more frequently, and perhaps more urgently, on what Derrida called “the question of the animal.” In this course we will look to how centering the animal challenges human exceptionalism, anthropocentrism, and traditional critical discourse. Tracing</span><span class="deschide"> the ways work in animal studies denaturalizes hierarchical taxonomies, defines key concepts such as human and animal, and articulates boundaries between species, this course will follow the various political, relational, ethical and imaginative implications of thinking with animals.</span><br/>

This course will involve the actual building a gas chromatograph (GC) system for environmental research. In addition, we will provide the option of building a mini datalogging sensor for measuring basic environmental parameters using the Arduino platform. This course offered in</span><span class="deschide"> the spring semester is only open to those who have taken this first semester course (c179A), which covers the fundamental skills required to undertake this project.

The purpose of the course is to provide students with basic knowledge of how to plan for and conduct forest treatments. It is meant as a companion to silviculture, which is the planning out and scheduling of treatments in order to meet defined objectives in forests. As such, Forest Operations does not focus on the reason for conducting treatments but rather how they are done. Topics include the types of equipment that are used in thinning, harvesting</span><span class="deschide">, prescribed fire, and vegetation management. The administrative requirements involved with planning operations (e.g. permit acquisition and contracts) are covered, as are principles of road maintenance and road abandonment. Two weekend field trips are required. A prescribed fire will be planned</span><br/>

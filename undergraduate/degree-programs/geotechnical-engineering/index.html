				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Minor</h3>
<p>The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering offers a minor program in Geotechnical Engineering. Geotechnical Engineering is traditionally an interdisciplinary field, drawing on elements of geology, geophysics, and the mechanics of fluids and solids. This breadth can be obtained by combining an undergraduate major in physical and mathematical sciences with a minor in Geotechnical Engineering. This minor is suitable for students interested in either professional practice or in graduate studies within the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Berkeley, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>There is no major program in Geotechnical Engineering.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Minor</h3>
<p>To be considered for admission to the minor, students should:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Have earned an overall grade-point average (GPA) of 3.0.</li>
	<li>Have completed the lower division prerequisite courses with a GPA of 3.0 (for further information regarding the prerequisites, see the Minor Requirements tab on this page).</li>
	<li>Be able to complete the minor without delaying graduation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon admission to the minor, students should:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Complete a minimum of five courses, of which no more than one can be counted toward the requirements of the major(s).</li>
	<li>Earn a minimum grade-point average of 2.0 in the upper division courses used for the minor.</li>
</ul>
<p>After completion of the prerequisite courses, students need to complete and submit to the Civil and Environmental Academic Affairs Office (750 Davis Hall) a Minor Program Application form.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the minor requirements, the student must complete and submit to the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department’s Office of Academic Affairs the Confirmation of Completion form during the first 2 weeks of the term in which the minor will be completed.</p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Minor programs are areas of concentration requiring fewer courses than an undergraduate major. These programs are optional, but can provide depth and breadth to a UC Berkeley education. The College of Engineering does not offer additional time to complete a minor, but it is usually possible to finish within the allotted time with careful course planning. Students are encouraged to meet with their ESS adviser to discuss the feasibility of completing a minor program.</p>
<p>All the engineering departments offer minors. Students may also consider pursuing a minor in another school or college.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>​All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be taken for graded credit.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 and a minimum GPA of 3.0 in the prerequisite courses is required for acceptance into the minor program.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student’s major and minor programs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Completion of the minor program cannot delay a student’s graduation.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

This is an introductory course on the finite element method and is intended for seniors in engineering and applied science disciplines. The course covers the basic topics of finite element technology, including domain discretization, polynomial interpolation, application of boundary conditions, assembly of global arrays, and solution of the resulting algebraic systems. Finite element formulations for several important field equations are</span><span class="deschide"> introduced using both direct and integral approaches. Particular emphasis is placed on computer simulation and analysis of realistic engineering problems from solid and fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and electromagnetism. The course uses FEMLAB, a multiphysics MATLAB-based finite element program that possesses a wide array of modeling capabilities and is ideally suited for instruction. Assignments will involve both paper- and computer-based exercises. Computer-based assignments will emphasize the practical aspects of finite element model construction and analysis.</span><br/>

The problems include design of a public transportation system for an urban area, resource allocation for the maintenance of a water supply system, development of repair and replacement policies for reinforced concrete bridge decks, traffic</span><span class="deschide"> signal control for an arterial street, scheduling in a large-scale construction project.</span><br/>

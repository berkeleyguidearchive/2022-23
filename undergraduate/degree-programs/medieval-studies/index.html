				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Minor</h3>
<p>The program in Medieval Studies offers an undergraduate interdisciplinary minor in Medieval Studies. The minor has three principal purposes:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>To give undergraduate students who have an interest in Medieval Studies the benefit of advising about what courses are available in the various departments and how certain courses might fit together into a meaningful sequence or cluster.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>To enable students to be informed about lectures, colloquia, social events, and conferences of interest to them.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>To allow those undergraduates who complete substantial work in Medieval Studies to have that fact acknowledged. Should those students wish to pursue further academic work after graduation, their chances of success in the competition for admission to graduate school will be enhanced not just because of the official notice on their transcript but because they will have gained greater professional competence through informed participation in the Medieval Studies program at Berkeley.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<h3>Declaring the Minor</h3>
<p>Students may declare the Medieval Studies Minor once they have declared a major and completed one upper-division course towards the minor.  At that time, students should meet with the Medieval Studies Minor Adviser to fill out a Minor Registration Card.  Undergraduate Minor Advising office hours can be found <a href="http://medieval.berkeley.edu/people/administration" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://medieval.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Program Website</a></p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>​<span>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but they are not noted on diplomas.</span></p>
<p>General Guidelines</p>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>A minimum of three of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement, for Letters &amp; Science students.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which the student plans to graduate. If students cannot finish all courses required for the minor by that time, they should see a College of Letters &amp; Science adviser.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed within the unit ceiling. (For further information regarding the unit ceiling, please see the College Requirements tab.)</li>
	<li>Please visit the <a href="http://medieval.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate">Medieval Studies Undergraduate Minor webpage</a> for more information on the minor and qualifying courses.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Recommended Courses</h3>
<p>Students who are contemplating advanced work in Medieval Studies should, if possible, take <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTORY%204B" title="HISTORY 4B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTORY 4B');">HISTORY 4B</a></span>  early in their undergraduate career. Other lower division courses are also recommended (e.g., <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ITALIAN%2030" title="ITALIAN 30" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ITALIAN 30');">ITALIAN 30</a></span>), but only upper division courses can be counted toward the minor.</p>

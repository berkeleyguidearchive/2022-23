				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Rausser College of Natural Resources offers the undergraduate major in Environmental Economics and Policy (EEP). This major provides an opportunity to explore aspects of economic and political institutions that affect the development and management of natural resources and the environment. The program takes a problem-solving approach to issues involving renewable and fixed natural resources, and it is based on a foundation in microeconomic theory and the economics of resources and the environment. The environmental economics and policy program is offered by the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics. <span>This major leads to a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree. </span><span>Students who graduate with a degree in environmental economics and policy go on to a variety of jobs or graduate programs.</span></p>
<p><strong><em>Note: The BA in Environmental Economics &amp; Policy was discontinued after Summer 2022.  Students wishing to pursue Environmental Economics &amp; Policy as a major may apply to the BS in the Rausser College of Natural Resources.</em></strong></p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Advice on admission for freshmen and transfer students can be found on Rausser College's<a href="/2022-23/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/#admissionstext" target="_blank"> Admissions Guide website</a> or Rausser College's<a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/prospective-students" target="_blank"> Prospective Student website</a>. Freshman students may apply directly to the major or may select Rausser College's undeclared option, and declare the major by the end of their fourth semester. Transfer students may apply directly to the major through Rausser College and, if admitted, be declared as EEP majors.</p>
<p>Information for current Berkeley students who would like to declare the major after admission, including information on a change of major or change of college, please see Chapter 6 of the <a href=" https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook">Rausser College of Natural Resources Undergraduate Student Handbook</a><a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook">.</a></p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Students with a GPA of 3.6 or higher may enroll in Rausser College's honors program (H196) once they have reached upper division standing. To fulfill the program requirements, students design, conduct, and report on an individual research project, working with a faculty sponsor. For further information about registration for the honors symposium or the honors requirements, please see <a href="http://nature.berkeley.edu/site/honors_program.php">Rausser College's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The minor program offers interested students an opportunity to explore aspects of economic and political institutions that affect the development and management of natural resources and the environment. For information regarding how to declare the minor, please contact the department.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://are.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but they are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process. </li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>At least one of the five upper division courses below must be taken during the academic year (i.e., not all courses may be Summer Session courses).</p>

				<a name="collegerequirementscollegeofnaturalresourcestext"></a><h2>College Requirements: College of Natural Resources</h2> <p><a href="/2022-23/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/reading-composition-requirement/">Reading and Composition</a></p> <p>In order to provide a solid foundation in reading, writing and critical thinking all majors in the College require two semesters of lower division work in composition. Students must complete a first-level reading and composition course by the end of their second semester and a second-level course by the end of their fourth semester.</p> <p><a href="/2022-23/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/foreign-language-requirement/">Foreign Language</a>: <strong>EEP Majors only</strong></p> <p>The Foreign Language requirement is only required by Environmental Economics and Policy (EEP) majors. It may be satisfied by demonstrating proficiency in reading comprehension, writing, and conversation in a foreign language equivalent to the second semester college level, either by passing an exam or by completing approved course work.</p> <p><a href="/2022-23/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/quantitative-reasoning-requirement/">Quantitative Reasoning</a>: <strong>EEP Majors only</strong></p> <p>The Quantitative Reasoning requirement is only required by Environmental Economics and Policy (EEP) majors. The requirement may be satisfied by exam or by taking an approved course.</p> <h3>Undergraduate Breadth</h3> <p>Undergraduate breadth provide Berkeley students with a rich and varied educational experience outside of their major program and many students complete their breadth courses in their first two years. Breadth courses are built into the Rausser College major requirements and each major requires a different number of breath courses and categories. The EEP major is the only college major that requires the entire 7 course breadth. Refer to the major snapshots on each <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/majors-minors" target="_blank">Rausser College major page</a> for additional information. </p> <h3>High School Exam Credit</h3> <p>Rausser College students may apply high school exam credit (Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, A-Level Exam) towards many College and Major Requirements. See <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/courses-grades#AP%20Exam%20Equivalency%20Chat" target="_blank">AP Exam Equivalency Chart and Higher Level IB Exam Equivalency Chart</a> in the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">Rausser College Student Handbook</a> for more information.</p> <h3>Unit Requirements</h3> <p>Students must complete at least 120 semester units of courses subject to certain guidelines:</p> <ul> 	<li>At least 36 units must be upper division courses, including a minimum of 15 units of upper division courses in the Rausser College. </li> 	<li>A maximum of 16 units of Special Studies coursework (courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, 198, or 199) is allowed towards the 120 units; a maximum of four is allowed in a given semester.</li> 	<li>A maximum of 4 units of Physical Education from any school attended will count towards the 120 units.</li> 	<li>Students may receive unit credit for courses graded P (including P/NP units taken through EAP) up to a limit of one-third of the total units taken and passed on the Berkeley campus at the time of graduation.  Courses taken for P/NP in the Spring 2020 semester will not count toward this limit.</li> </ul> <h4>Semester Unit Minimum</h4> <p>All Rausser College students must enroll in at least 12 units each fall and spring semester.</p> <h4>Semester Unit Maximum</h4> <p>To request permission to take more than 20.5 units in a semester, please see the major adviser.</p> <h3>Semester Limit</h3> <p>Students admitted as freshmen must graduate within 8 fall/spring semesters at UC Berkeley. Students admitted as transfer students must graduate within 4 fall/spring semesters at UC Berkeley. Students who go on EAP and UCDC can petition for additional semesters. Other UC-affiliated programs, such as the Gump Station in Moorea, may also be considered.  Summer session, UC Extension and non-UC study abroad programs do not count towards this semester limit. Students approved for double majors or  simultaneous degrees in two colleges may be granted an additional semester. Rausser College does not limit the number of total units a student can accrue.</p> <h3>Senior Residence Requirement</h3> <p>Once you achieve and exceed 90 units (senior status), you must complete at least 24 of the remaining 30 units in residence at the Rausser College of Natural Resources over at least 2 semesters. To count as residence, a semester must consist of at least 6 passed units taken while the student is a member of Rausser. At least one of the two terms must be a fall or spring semester. Senior residence terms do not need to be completed consecutively. All courses offered on campus for the fall, spring, and summer terms by Berkeley departments and programs and all Berkeley online ('W') courses count. Inter-campus Visitor, Education Abroad Program, UC Berkeley Washington Program, and UC Berkeley Extension units do not count toward this requirement.  Students may use Summer Session to satisfy one semester of the Senior Residence Requirement, provided that 6 units of coursework are completed.</p> <h3>Modified Senior Residence Requirement</h3> <p>Participants in a fall, spring or summer UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP), Berkeley Summer Abroad, or the UC Berkeley Washington Program may meet a modified Senior Residence Requirement by completing 24 of their final 60 semester units in residence (excluding UCEAP). At least 12 of these 24 units must be completed after senior status is reached. International travel study programs sponsored by Summer Sessions and education abroad programs offered outside of the UC system do not qualify for modified senior residence.</p> <p>Most students automatically satisfy the residence requirement by attending classes here for four years. In general, there is no need to be concerned about this requirement, unless students go abroad for a semester or year or want to take courses at another institution or through University Extension during their senior year. In these cases, students should make an appointment to see an adviser to determine how they can meet the Senior Residence Requirement.</p> <h3>Grade Requirements</h3> <ul> 	<li>A 2.0 UC GPA is required for graduation.</li> 	<li>A 2.0 average in all upper division courses required of the major program is required for graduation.</li> 	<li>A grade of at least C- is required in all courses for the major.  Major and minor coursework taken in Spring 2020, Fall 2020, and Spring 2021 may be completed with P/NP grading option.  See more details below.</li> </ul> <h3><span id="docs-internal-guid-d18ac9d6-7fff-a2c9-bcde-b1106ed17aba">Changes in Policies and Procedures during the COVID-19 Pandemic</span></h3> <h5><span id="docs-internal-guid-d18ac9d6-7fff-a2c9-bcde-b1106ed17aba">Fall 2020, Spring 2021, SUMMER 2021 </span></h5> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-d18ac9d6-7fff-a2c9-bcde-b1106ed17aba">After much consultation across the colleges of UC Berkeley, and via our college Executive Committee, the following decisions have been made about the selection of the P/NP grade option (CPN) by undergraduate students during the </span>Fall 2020 &amp; Spring 2021 semesters for the Rausser College of Natural Resources.</p> <ul> 	<li> 	<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-d18ac9d6-7fff-a2c9-bcde-b1106ed17aba">College Course Requirements: </span>Reading and Composition, Quantitative Reasoning, and Foreign Language requirements normally satisfied with letter grades may be met with a passed (P) grade during the Fall 2020 semester.  This does not include the system-wide Entry Level Writing requirement.

This course is a self-contained introduction to the economics of climate change. Climate change is caused by a large variety of economic activities, and many of its impacts will have economic consequences. Economists have studied climate change for more than two decades, and economic arguments are often powerful in policy decisions. The course will familiarize students with these arguments and equip them with the tools to participate</span><span class="deschide"> in discussions of climate change policy through an economic lens.</span><br/>

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> The course will start with a brief review of the science of climate change, discuss scenarios of economic growth and the greenhouse gas emissions caused by economic activities and investigate various emission reduction opportunities and their economic costs. A significant amount of time will be spent on studying the impacts of climate change, their economic evaluation and how adaptation can lower the costs of climate damages.<br/>
<br/>We will then study various theoretical frameworks economists have developed that answer the question how estimates about the costs and benefits of climate policy can be combined to find “good” climate policies. We then study three more specialized topics that turn out to be of great importance when analyzing climate change policy: first, how do we compare costs and benefits of generations that live many centuries apart? Second, how do we design climate policy when our projections of both the costs and the benefits of climate policy are highly uncertain? And third, how can equity considerations be accounted for in an economic assessment of climate change policy? The course will close with a look at international cooperation on climate policy and why it has been so difficult to agree on effective treatises that implement climate change policy.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Students will also have gained insight into the practical aspects of modeling the economics of climate change by building a simple integrated assessment model in Excel. They will be able to use that model to do simple analysis of climate change policy themselves.<br/>
Students will be familiar with the tools economists use to analyze climate change policy. They will have studied empirical estimates of the costs and benefits of climate policy and have an understanding of the analytical issues that drive research on the economics of climate change.</p></div>

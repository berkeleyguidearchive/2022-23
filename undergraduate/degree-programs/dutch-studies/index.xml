<ul>
	<li><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Elementary Dutch 1 and Intermediate Dutch 2 or equivalent</li>
	<li>A minimum of 30 upper division units.

		<li><strong>Required course: </strong>Advanced Dutch 110</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Additional courses are to be selected from the following courses:

		<li>Topics in Dutch Literature Dutch 140</li>
		<li>Travel/Study Course Dutch 177</li>
		<li>Senior Thesis Dutch 190</li>
		<li>Capstone course Dutch 195</li>

		<li>One course in the Dutch 170-series (may be repeated as topics change)</li>
		<li>A maximum of two related upper-division courses outside of the Department (with approval by the Program Director)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div> </div>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the major requirements below must be taken for graded credit, other than courses listed which are offered on a <em>Pass/No Pass</em> basis only. Other exceptions to this requirement are noted as applicable.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs, with the exception of minors offered outside of the College of Letters &amp; Science.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be maintained in both upper and lower division courses used to fulfill the major requirements.</li>
</ol>
<p>For information regarding residence requirements and unit requirements, please see the College Requirements tab.</p>
<p><span>As flexibility and interdepartmental cooperation are of essential importance to the </span>Dutch Studies<span> Program, there are no requirement courses for the Dutch major besides the Dutch language courses. This enables students to compose the Dutch major according to their personal interests. It also makes it easier to add </span>Dutch Studies<span> as a double major. Due to the fact that the number of upper division courses offered in the </span>Dutch Studies<span> program is limited, we strongly encourage students considering a a major in </span>Dutch Studies<span> to apply to the UC Berkeley Study Abroad Program.  Furthermore, s</span>tudents who study abroad at a Dutch or Belgian university can apply for equivalents to be counted to the Dutch Studies Major, depending on approval by the Program Director.&quot;</p>

<p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but are not noted on diplomas.</p>

<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The structural idea of Berkeley’s Dutch Studies Program is that Dutch Studies are also world studies. Each course in the program allows students to learn about the Low Countries (the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg) and to sharpen their view of world history, global problems and transnational cultural connections. The program offers four levels of Dutch language acquisition in combination with a rich variety of English-taught courses dedicated to the culture, language, politics and history of the Low Countries. In cooperation with Summer Sessions, Dutch Studies also organizes an annual travel study course: The Amsterdam-Brussels Connection.</p>
<h3><span>Learning Goals for the Major</span></h3>
<ol>
	<li><span>Dutch History is World History</span>
	<ul>
		<li>Through a broad curriculum, Dutch studies offers a critical reflection on the multicultural past and present of the Netherlands. Few European countries have as profound a legacy as the Netherlands in both colonial and post-colonial studies. Some of the best world literature has been written in the former Dutch East Indies and in the Dutch-speaking Caribbean. Traces of Dutch influence can be found all over the world, from Japan and Indonesia to South Africa to the United States, where present-day New York City goes back to the former Dutch colony of New Amsterdam.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Dutch Politics are World Politics
	<ul>
		<li>Dutch studies offers a critical reflection on the political past and present of the Low Countries. Few European countries have as profound a legacy in freedom, liberty, and tolerance as the Netherlands. Historically, it was not the aristocracy, as in most European nations, but the citizenry that shaped Dutch culture and identity. Its strong attachment to freedom is what makes the Netherlands unique in the world as a model for progressiveness. The Dutch Act of Abjuration of 1581 served as a model of inspiration for the American Declaration of Independence.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Dutch Economy is a World Economy
	<ul>
		<li>Dutch studies pays attention to the importance of the economy in the Low Countries. Located at the estuary of some of Europe’s most important rivers, the Low Countries represent a vital economic artery of the European continent. According to some of the world’s leading historians, the Netherlands became the first modern economy in the world in the 17th century. Today, the Netherlands is the third biggest foreign investor in the United States. The present-day Low Countries (the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg) represent the fourth biggest export economy in the world. Europe’s two biggest seaports are located in the Low Countries (Rotterdam and Antwerp), as is the EU capital in the Dutch and French-speaking city of Brussels.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Dutch Culture is a World Culture
	<ul>
		<li>Dutch studies offers a profound study of the cultural importance of the Low Countries. The singular development of the Netherlands has been accompanied by splendid cultural achievements in painting, book printing, architecture, and literature right through contemporary dance and design. Dutch culture is represented by several of the world’s most famous painters, from van Eyck to Rembrandt and from Vermeer to Van Gogh.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Dutch Language is a World Language
	<ul>
		<li>Dutch studies offers four levels of Dutch language acquisition from introductory to advanced Dutch as well as a linguistic course on the structure of modern Dutch. While Dutch is the mother tongue of approximately 23 million people in Europe (some 17 million in the Netherlands and 6 million in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium), it is also spoken by half a million people in the Caribbean and, although in a creolized form, by some 6 million people in South Africa. Due to its colonial legacy, knowledge of Dutch language proves to be of essential importance for scholars interested in the history of Japan, South East Asia, South Africa, the Caribbean and the early European colonization of the United States.</li>

With the 17th-century &quot;Golden Age&quot; as its starting point, the course traces the important cultural developments in Holland and Belgium (Flanders) up to the present. The interdisciplinary curriculum provides a clear picture of these two constrasting monarchies. The historical, cultural, and linguistic relationship is a constant focus of the course. The literature (documentary</span><span class="deschide"> and fiction) concentrates on the Holcaust in the Low Countries. Students will engage with their subject matter not only in daily lectures, but also as eyewitnesses through regular field trips to museums and historical sites in Amsterdam, The Hague, Haarlem, Delft, Antwerp, Bruges, Ghent, Brussels, and other cities. Visits to the Royal Palace in Amsterdam, the House of Representatives, an interactive criminal trial, attendance at the International Court of Arbitration in The Hague, and the European Parliament in Brussels are included in the course.</span><br/>

This capstone project is designed to allow students to “finish off” their Dutch minors and majors in such a way as to return to, develop, and synthesize what they have learned in the minor or major. Students will begin by reviewing their previous seminar paper with faculty and highlighting passages that could use re-crafting, argument elements that are not strong, and points where research could be added. They will then proceed to revise and expand their paper, providing</span><span class="deschide"> occasional progress reports and other short assignments to keep them moving forward. They will submit various components of the in-progress revisions to their adviser for comment and feedback.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Department of History offers a program of instruction ranging widely over the historical record of human experience. The chronological, geographical, and topical range affords great flexibility to students working toward degrees in history and to those who wish to give a historical dimension to their studies in other disciplines. History at Berkeley is a highly flexible major that allows students to follow their interests. It is also a major that places strong value on original student research, with all students completing capstone projects on topics they choose in consultation with members of the faculty.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Students may declare the major after completing three letter-graded courses in the Department of History with a 2.0 grade-point average (GPA) or better. This must include at least two lower division courses.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>To graduate with honors in History, a major must achieve a general GPA of 3.5, a departmental GPA of 3.7, and a minimum grade of &quot;A-&quot; in <span class="sc_courseinline">HISTORY 101</span>. To be eligible for graduation with high or highest honors in History, a major must complete the one-year thesis program, achieve a general GPA of 3.5, a departmental GPA of 3.7, and a grade of &quot;A&quot; in <span class="sc_courseinline">HISTORY 101</span>. The student must also receive a nomination for high or highest honors from the 101 instructor. The decision to award high or highest honors rests with the Honors Committee.</p>
<p>A major who is eligible for honors after completing <span class="sc_courseinline">HISTORY 101</span> (but not the one-year thesis program) and is interested in continued research may pursue a second thesis project under the rubric <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTORY%20H195" title="HISTORY H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTORY H195');">HISTORY H195</a></span>. The second project may substitute for the 101 thesis in determining eligibility for high or highest honors if the student meets the GPA standards and receives a nomination from the H195 instructor.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The Department of History offers a minor in History.</p>
<p>Students are welcome to meet with the minor advisor to file a &quot;History Minor Application&quot; once they have completed at least one course towards the minor.  Students who have taken their lower division minor course elsewhere should indicate the school on the application so the course can be verified on <a href="http://assist.org/" target="_blank">assist.org</a> and the grade can be verified through CalCentral.</p>
<p>All students must submit a completed “History Minor Application” no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT).  If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions.  L&amp;S students must additionally submit a signed &quot;Completion of L&amp;S Minor&quot; during their final semester.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://history.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

<h3>Field of Concentration Requirement</h3>
<p>At least four of the eight upper-division courses must constitute a Field of Concentration, which shall be defined by one of the following rubrics:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a period (such as “The Ancient World,” “The Medieval World,” “The Twentieth Century,” or a similarly broad temporal span)</li>
	<li>a geographical area (such as “Eastern Europe,” “China,” “The Mediterranean,” or a similarly broad spatial expanse)</li>
	<li>a thematic approach (such as “Science and Medicine,” “Law,” “Popular Culture,” “Religion,” or a similarly broad subject matter)</li>
</ul>
<p>The four courses constituting the Field of Concentration must include History 101.The three additional courses in the Field may include a course from the History 103 series. They may also include one appropriate upper-division course (of at least three units) from another department (in consultation with the Undergraduate Advisor.)</p>
<h3><span>Pre-Modern Requirement</span></h3>
<p>At least one course used to fulfill the major requirements must be devoted entirely to pre-modern history, to be selected from courses focused on one or more of the following eras: antiquity, the classical period, and the medieval period. Courses dealing solely with the early modern period do not satisfy this requirement.</p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but they are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>The History minor consists of six four-unit courses: one lower division and five upper division, from at least two of the seven historical fields below.</li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade.</li>
	<li>An overall GPA of 2.0 is required for all coursework applied to the minor.</li>
	<li>All of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the History minor requirements must be completed at Berkeley in the Department of History. The lower division course may be taken at a California community college; only articulated courses will count (please see assist.org for a full list of currently articulated courses).</li>
	<li>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement, for L&amp;S students.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</li>
	<li>Students can declare the minor as soon as they have completed at least one History course at Berkeley.  Students must declare the minor before the end of their penultimate semester at Berkeley.</li>
	<li>L&amp;S students must additionally submit a signed Completion of L&amp;S Minor to the Department of History during their final semester.</li>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The History major helps students learn to think critically and deeply about the historical processes that have shaped the world we live in. History majors are exposed to a temporally and geographically broad range of historical experience, but they are also required to concentrate on a world region or theme or a period in history, both in order to develop depth of understanding and in order to prepare for the capstone of the History major: an article-length, primary-source based, original research project. The major is designed to develop critical reading, thinking, and writing skills that will be needed to succeed in this capstone course.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Distinguish and characterize significant periods of historical experience in multiple societies from different parts of the globe.</li>
	<li>Describe events and developments in the history of multiple societies in terms of continuity, change, and causation.</li>
	<li>Understand interpretive debates about the past.</li>
	<li>Appreciate the complexities involved in interpreting societies and social change: for example, the local and the global, particular and general, contingent and structural.</li>
	<li>Identify different kinds of historical evidence and understand their role in the production of historical knowledge.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Recall factual claims about the past and synthesize them into coherent interpretive arguments.</li>
	<li>Read documents closely and critically.</li>
	<li>Formulate a well-organized, well-supported argument.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate clear writing in the form of essays of varying lengths.</li>
	<li>Make cogent oral arguments about reading assignments in the context of a seminar discussion.</li>
	<li>Conduct original research with primary sources.</li>
	<li>Locate good, relevant secondary scholarship, and distinguish good from poor scholarship.</li>
	<li>Observe ethical practices of citation and intellectual self-presentation.</li>

This course is an introduction to the history of the United States from the beginning of the European colonization of North America to the end of the Civil War. It is also an introduction to the ways historians look at the past and think about evidence.

Science as we know is the product of a historical process. In this course, we will explore the emergence of its concepts, practices, goals, and cognitive authority by surveying its roots in their social and cultural setting. We will trace the development of conceptions of the natural world from antiquity through the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment and up to the modern age. All the sciences fall within our purview, from their early forms</span><span class="deschide"> up to today.</span><br/>

The goal of this course is to foster a critical engagement with humanitarian interventions in Africa. Through this course, we will develop a better understanding of the complexity of humanitarianism and its often-unintended consequences in different parts of Africa. Our approach is not prescriptive in the sense that it provides a course of action or a politics to follow. Instead, we use historical methodology as an analytical tool in evaluating</span><span class="deschide"> the connections between humanitarianism and Africa over more than two hundred years.</span><br/>

Neoliberalism has become a catch-word in social sciences. It is used by scholars from various disciplines and has different meanings. However, usually it is used to indicate some profound change that took place since the 1970s. Some even use it to describe the three decades that have followed the postwar period. In this seminar we will approach neoliberalism from a historical perspective, including the history of neoliberal ideas, neoliberal</span><span class="deschide"> transformations in a number of selected countries, the 2008-9 economic crisis, the neoliberalization of higher education, and the contentious relationship between neoliberalism and democracy.

In 2011, Bill Gates and David Christian launched a project for teaching “Big History” at high schools. In their definition, “Big History seeks to understand the integrated history of the Cosmos, Earth, Life, and Humanity, using the best available empirical evidence and scholarly methods.” The vocabulary, concepts, and environmental fears driving the project are distinctly twenty-first century. However, humanity has sought the exact same goals</span><span class="deschide"> for longer than two millennia already. The course will sample how ancient Greek philosophy and science were used in order to propose practically and morally relevant “Big History” at different times and places: Graeco-Roman antiquity, the Christian and Muslim Middle Ages, and the modern period.</span><br/>

A paradox lies at the heart of our visions of present-day South Asia: on the one hand, the region has witnessed explosive economic growth, leading some to speak of the next hundred years as an ‘Asian Century’. On the other hand, the countries of the region remain beset by enormous challenges, from the shadow of terrorism, the threat of nuclear war, the increasingly rapid slide into authoritarianism, the growth of religious violence and fundamentalism</span><span class="deschide">, resource scarcity and the looming environmental catastrophe – to name only a few. This course will explore this paradox through works of reportage, fiction and contemporary history from across the Indian subcontinent today.</span><br/>

This course covers the history of Scandinavian political society from the Viking invasions to the formation of kingdoms. After examining the attacks on England and the European Continent, discussion turns to Viking mythology, the colonization of the North Atlantic (including Vinland), and Icelandic feuding. A fair amount of attention will be devoted to archaeological excavations. The course also works with Norse mythologies, and the ways</span><span class="deschide"> the history of early Scandinavian kings was grafted into those mythologies. We will end with the beginnings of the Scandinavian kingdoms in the 13th century. Readings are both primary and secondary sources.

Sample topics to be explored include: definitions</span><span class="deschide"> of childhood and child labor; traditional constructions of children's work; colonialism, globalization and redefinition of children's work; gender and child labor; child abductions, child soldiers; sex slavery; and talibes.</span><br/>

Shanghai’s opening to foreign trade and residence after 1842 sparked its rapid growth into China’s largest metropolis, and one of the great cities of the world, less than a century later.

Ancient and medieval historians paid little attention to women. When they did, it was either to praise them lavishly or disparage them irredeemably. Their impoverished view of women’s lives stands in stark contrast to the material available from other sources, both textual and artistic. In this class we shall consider the gamut of women’s experiences, such as social, religious and gender roles, economic and legal rights, faith, passions, and</span><span class="deschide"> religious responsibilities. We will read about Greek priestesses and Christian martyrs, wives and queens, poets and benefactors. This class will be organized chronologically and will cover select topics from ancient Greece, Rome, and early Byzantium.</span><br/>

In this connector course, we will explore how historical data becomes historical evidence and how recent technological advances affect long-established practices, such as close attention to historical context and contingency. Will the advent of fast computing and big data make history “count” more or lead to unprecedented insights into the study of change over time? During our weekly discussions, we will apply what we learn in lectures and</span><span class="deschide"> labs to the analysis of selected historical sources and get an understanding of constructing historical datasets.

This course explores African history before 1800: How and why did complex societies form in Africa? Why did states form in some place and times and not others? What technological responses did different Africans make to environmental changes? How did various cultures, religions, and state ideologies help to organize African social and political formations? What effect did the medieval and early-modern trade in African slaves have on African social</span><span class="deschide"> and political formations? We will attempt to answer these questions from both theoretical and historiographical perspectives by engaging with academic debates on some of these issues, and by looking at the viewpoints of African historical actors themselves using primary sources.</span><br/>

Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of</span><span class="deschide"> women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the &quot;subaltern&quot; classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.</span><br/>

Between the 16th and the 19th century China was home to the world’s largest empire and economy. Beijing sat at the center of an East Asian order of trade, tribute, and learning. China reached the height of its continental power around 1800. Meanwhile Western European ships began sailing into East Asian waters. These ships facilitated long-distance exchanges of goods and ideas by the sea.<br/>
This course examines the question: What mattered</span><span class="deschide"> more in the shaping of modern China thereafter: the Inner Asian origins of the Chinese governing system or the dynamics of a globalizing maritime economy and society?

In this course, our primary concerns will be 1) the built environment -- village form, houses, temples; 2) village festivals and domestic rituals; 3) the rituals and scriptures of local cults; 4) operas, storytelling, and other forms of village entertainment; and 5) popular visual arts. These subjects will be studied</span><span class="deschide"> through both written and visual documentation.</span><br/>

This course brings a thematic approach to the critical analysis of the visual in Chinese history. In focusing on key elements of material culture and emphasizing how they have been viewed at specific moments in Chinese history, the course teaches students of history how to achieve a more balanced picture of the past drawn from both visual and literary records. Inevitably, the course tries to determine for a particular temporal and geographical setting</span><span class="deschide"> what's ordinary or conventional and what's not; also to rethink the metaphors that currently dominate thinking about history in China. No prior acquaintance with Chinese history is required for the course.</span><br/>

This class will explore in depth some of the most important changes and how they were connected. We will also examine what did not change, and how state and local priorities persisted in many arenas. Among the topics addressed: population movements and efforts to control immigration; the growth</span><span class="deschide"> of corporations and trade unions; the campaign for women's suffrage; Prohibition; an end to child labor; the institution of the Jim Crow system; and the reshaping of higher education.</span><br/>

Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part</span><span class="deschide"> of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.</span><br/>

Latinx peoples are the largest U.S. minority group. How and why did so many different peoples come to be seen as like one another and as not “American”? Although often perceived as “aliens” or foreigners, Latinx peoples have lived in North America since before the nation existed. In the words of historian Vicki Ruiz, “Our America is American history.” As we move across Nuestra América from precolonial times to the present, we will examine diverse cultural</span><span class="deschide"> practices, social movements, processes of community formation, intellectual trajectories, and responses to U.S. empire and white supremacy. We will also consider how race, class, gender, sexuality, and indigeneity have shaped belonging and inclusion within Latinx communities.<br/></span><br/>

This course introduces students to the history of Mexican and Mexican American peoples in the United States. It begins in the precolonial Americas with an emphasis on North America and the region that later became the U.S. Southwest, and it ends in our present moment. It contextualizes historical moments, processes, and ideologies that continue to shape the lives of Mexican Americans: conquest, capitalism, heteropatriarchy, mestizaje, and white</span><span class="deschide"> supremacy. Rooted in social history, the course emphasizes the struggles of everyday people to improve the circumstances of their lives. It asks students to examine U.S. history from the perspective of communities often erased in national narratives.</span><br/>

The U.S. military has served as an engine of socio-economic mobility, and changes in its personnel policies often foreshadowed the reordering of American society. However, the U.S. military has also been a space in which the federal government actively discriminated against many Americans—people of color, women, immigrants, religious minorities, and queer people. This course is neither a history of American wars nor a traditional military history focused on battles</span><span class="deschide"> and strategy; rather it explores the social dynamics of the U.S. military from the American Revolution to the present and investigates how the military has reflected, resisted, influenced, and heralded social, cultural, political, and religious transformations in American life.</span><br/>

This course surveys religion in the land that became the United States from colonial contact with indigenous people to the present with an emphasis on how religion has shaped, and been shaped by, the American experience.

What are the relationships between various American religious traditions and American society, politics</span><span class="deschide">, and culture?

In this course we will be discussing key developments in U.S. thought since the middle of the nineteenth century, roughly beginning with the reception of Darwin. The broader story told in the class weaves together in the history of science and engineering, the arts and popular culture, philosophy, and education. Our goal is to trace how ideas, whether they are dominant, challenging, or look back, have affected the ways in which Americans</span><span class="deschide"> live together. We will look at how intellectual life has empowered and expanded the capacity of Americans to understand their world and achieve goals more effectively. We will also consider how intellectual theories have contributed to inequality and injustice.</span><br/>

As longstanding symbols in U.S. history and culture, “Wall Street” and “Main Street” refer to streets that intersect at right angles and places that represent the antithesis of each other: Wall Street is home to nefarious big banks run by greedy financiers, while Main Street is home to “mom-and-pop” shops patronized by people of modest means who live in the surrounding wholesome small towns.

The data we use both reflects our values and shapes them, structuring the questions we ask and answer about the world. This course will examine the history of American data collection and analysis, from the census to opinion polling to sports.

We will also analyze quantitative documents to learn about</span><span class="deschide"> the past—both through close reading and through aggregation and statistical analysis.

For most of human history, urban living has been the experience of a distinct minority. Only in the past two hundred years have the physicial spaces, social relations, and lifestyles associated with large cities entered the mainstream. This course examines the long century of urban growth between 1825 and 1933, when big cities came into being in the United States. Focusing on large metropolitian centers (especially on New York, Chicago, and San</span><span class="deschide"> Francisco), we will study the way urban spaces provided sites and sources of new modes of personal interaction, popular entertainment, social conflict, and political expression.</span><br/>

The early colonial period in the Americas is one of history’s most traumatic, astonishing, and consequential eras. This lecture class compares and contrasts histories of encounter, resistance, conquest, and colonization in three regions of indigenous America: Hispaniola, the Valley of Mexico, and the St. Lawrence River Valley. Each section will begin with regional geography and indigenous and European contexts on the eve of contact. As the</span><span class="deschide"> class progresses, lectures and discussions of primary sources will interrogate the dynamics that gave rise to the complex and profoundly unequal American societies of the early colonial period, with their stratified, diverse populations.</span><br/>

World War II lifted the U.S. from the Great Depression and launched a long economic boom that helped underwrite and propel efforts on behalf of greater racial equality and economic equity. As that boom began to fade in the late 1960s, America’s march toward greater racial equality foundered, while its march toward greater economic equity began to reverse course. The Civil Rights Era gave way to the New Gilded Age. This course will explore the political, legal, and</span><span class="deschide"> economic history of America’s struggles for racial equality and economic equity – and the relationship between them.</span><br/>

How have inhabitants of Cuba struggled against</span><span class="deschide"> ongoing relationships of colonialism and dependency with foreign powers?

This course explores the history of medieval England from the Norman Conquest of 1066 to the end of the Wars of The Roses in 1485. The conquest radically changed English politics and society. The new rulers drew the kingdom into the politics and conflicts of continental Europe. At the same time England expanded at the expense of its neighbors in the British Isles, and faced recurring internal conflicts among its aristocracy</span><span class="deschide"> and royal families. Alongside the history of kings and battles, we will study the economic, social, cultural and intellectual life of the realm, the development of its distinctive political and legal systems, and the social and religious upheavals which rocked England in the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.<br/></span><br/>

Was Britain the maker of the modern world? This small, cold, and wet island was the first to develop representative politics, to industrialize, to urbanize, and to infamously build a global empire. And yet it was unable to rid itself of ancient institutions like the monarchy, the aristocracy, and the established church. The class explores this paradox by tracing the rise, fall and reinvention of a ‘liberal’ political economy that laid out how markets</span><span class="deschide">, governments, empires, and even people, should work. It shows how people of color, as subjects of slavery and imperialism, as well as residents of Britain, were integral to this story. It concludes Britain did not make the modern world, the world helped make Britain modern.</span><br/>

The eighteenth century in Europe witnessed a series of &quot;revolutions&quot;--intellectual, political, and to a lesser extent, social and economic--that together constitute the birth rites of modern European society and culture. Historians collectively agree that the Enlightenment, the French Revolution, and the European expansion of Napoleonic France were events of world-historical significance, yet the causes and precise meaning of these</span><span class="deschide"> events are the subjects of substantial disagreement. We will study the transformations of the eighteenth century that announced our modern world, and we will also try to make sense of the different ways that historians disagree about the meaning of what happened.</span><br/>

Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the Soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and from</span><span class="deschide"> there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy.<br/>
The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of World War II.<br/></span><br/>

This is an upper-division survey of French History from the Renaissance through the French Revolution (1500-1800). The course explores the economic, political and cultural factors that allowed France to emerge as the most powerful nation and global actor in Europe from the end of the middle ages to the reign of Louis XIV. We examine the extent of the kingdom's military, political and cultural influence and the realities of everyday life in 16th</span><span class="deschide"> and 17th century France. We then turn to the key developments of the eighteenth century—capitalism, colonialism, global conflict and Enlightenment—that led to the collapse of French monarchy in 1789 and the unfolding of the first democratic revolution in the West.</span><br/>

This course explores modern France and its place in the world. We begin with the French Revolution, one of the truly earth-shaking events in history, and then we follow French history through a series of monarchical, authoritarian, and democratic regimes. In the process, we will also trace the emergence, expansion and decline of a great colonial empire. Issues of focus include French cultural and intellectual life; empire as a way of life not</span><span class="deschide"> only for colonists but also for those living in mainland France; religion; immigration; battles over “who is French”; and dramatic changes in French economy and society during the past two centuries.</span><br/>

From the period of the Protestant Reformation to the era of enlightened despotism and the French Revolution, German history was characterized by severe conflicts and problems unresolved. Early Modern German history contains many lessons concerning the relationship of war and peace, of violence and toleration, of reform and renewal and the rejection of any change, of Baroque splendor and widespread misery, of some progress and much disappointment</span><span class="deschide">, in short: of a most complicated legacy for future generations.</span><br/>

A central theme is the struggle to define and impose a single national identity on socially, culturally, and religiously diverse peoples in an age of Great Power conflict. Although the region now known as Germany will be the focus of our investigation, considerable attention will also be paid</span><span class="deschide"> to the Hapsburg Empire, for until 1866 Austria was officially a part of &quot;Germany&quot; and remained, for nearly a century thereafter, culturally and in popular consciousness a part of a &quot;Greater Germany.&quot;</span><br/>

This course will focus on the history of Italy during a period when it was the leading center of European artistic and cultural production and the driving force in the revival of classical learning and literary ideals. This was the Italy of Raphael and Michelangelo, Ariosto and Alberti, Brunelleschi and Botticelli. At the same time, Italy was also a political battleground through most of this period, both in the realm of ideas and theory but also</span><span class="deschide"> in a literal sense. It was in Italy that &quot;the art of war,&quot; as Machiavelli called it, took center stage as the peninsula became one of the major theaters of war between the great powers of the age, France and Spain. The course will combine a study of the artistic, intellectual, religious, and political history of Italy in this period both as it developed internally and as it was related to the rest of Europe and the Mediterranean world. Requirements will include a midterm, a final, and an optional final paper.</span><br/>

The Romanovs ruled Russia from 1613 until 1917, when revolutions swept them from power. In three centuries, they transformed it from a landlocked country, inhabited largely by ethnic Russians, into a sprawling, western-oriented, multi-ethnic empire, governing well over 100 million people across some 8.6 million square miles. This course will focus on the techniques of rule that the Romanovs used to maintain and expand state power. It will inquire</span><span class="deschide"> into the extent and limits of the reach of the administrative and military apparatus into subjects’ public and private lives. Nominally, Russia was an autocracy. How powerful were Russia’s Romanov autocrats in practice? What can the Russian experience teach us about the nature of the modern state?</span><br/>

Nationalism, socialism, and gender defined collective and personal identity in Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union. As writers struggled to position themselves globally, they wondered whether Russia and the Soviet Union belonged to Europe or Asia. They also questioned elite culture amid economic and social oppression. For some, science and art held intrinsic value; others felt they must address social, gender, and ethnic disparity. As socialism</span><span class="deschide"> arose, so did debate as to which groups deserved greatest protection: agrarian laborers, industrial workers, ethnic minorities, or women. Perhaps, the family itself had to be abolished to achieve true equality. Readings will feature essays, articles, short stories, and novels.</span><br/>

Once again, Europeans are questioning the limits of coexistence. Recently we have watched a refugee crisis unfold and in the process have reopened discussions regarding who “belongs” in Europe. This course approaches these vexing question from a unique historical perspective, that of coexistence and otherness in both the “old” and “new” Europe. Specifically our laboratory includes Poland, the Czech Republic and Germany. We will utilize five case</span><span class="deschide"> studies (the Jews of Europe; the Roma of Northern Bohemia; the Vietnamese in Prague, the Turkish in Germany and recent refugees across the EU) to better understand how ideas of “Europe” and “Europeaness” changed over the past century.</span><br/>

France has the world’s second largest Jewish population outside of Israel. It has a rich and complex history that traces all the key developments of the Jewish experience since ancient times: expulsions and migrations; codification of Jewish law; religious reform; the rise of anti-Semitism and the tragedy of the Holocaust; struggles between</span><span class="deschide"> Ashkenazic and Sephardic Jews; complex relations between Muslims and Jews; the emergence modern Jewish politics; and the impact of the Israeli-Arab conflict.

The course takes us far beyond contemporary tensions between Muslims and Jews, and deep into a more complicated history that spans the Mediterranean and beyond. We move through topics that include the earliest encounters between Muslims and Jews during the years of the rise of Islam; the historical impact and legacy of the dhimmi (the system of rights and restrictions that defined Jews’ status for centuries under Islamic rule); the culturally fruitful shared</span><span class="deschide"> experience of Jews and Muslims in Medieval Spain and the Ottoman Empire; the effects of French, British, and Italian colonialism in the modern Middle East; and the important conflicts over Zionism and Arab nationalism during the past century.</span><br/>

The class explores the history of the Zionist movement and the State of Israel in all its complexity and contradictions. What is Zionism? What are its roots? Is it a liberation movement? A religious cause? A colonial ideology? A set of state policies? And what is the relationship between Zionism and the modern State of Israel? How do Zionism and Israel look different when considered from the standpoint of Jewish, Palestinian, European, or Middle Eastern history? Exploring</span><span class="deschide"> Zionism and Israel from its roots in the nineteenth century to the present, this class offers in-depth knowledge and discussion on all of these topics and more.</span><br/>

This course provides an overview of the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and apply them to a wide range of topics, including geography, history, environmental</span><span class="deschide"> and information science, and others. Questions this course will address include: how are scientific facts constructed? How are values embedded in technical systems?<br/></span><br/>

The history of medicine shows how societies have faced health crises in the past and how they have changed their approach to illness and disease over time. This class is a survey of the history of medicine in the U.S., focusing on changing concepts of disease, medical practices, institutions, patient experiences, and public health measures. In particular, the course examines how shifting ideas about gender, class, and race shaped experiences</span><span class="deschide"> of illness and suffering, as well as medical knowledge and education. While the course focuses on the history of American medicine, it acknowledges that changes in the practice, theory, and education of medicine often do not occur in isolation but are part of global developments.</span><br/>

What is love? An instinct, a thing of nature? Or an idea, a product of culture? European philosophers since Plato have sought answers to these questions, advancing in the process various theories about the relationship between nature, culture, and the human condition. This class considers these theories as a starting point of an historical exploration of love as represented in a variety of cultural artifacts from ancient Greece through the Middle Ages. Among</span><span class="deschide"> them are the poetry of Sappho and Ovid; Greek and Roman sculpture; ancient, Byzantine, and medieval romances; marriage chests and wedding hymns; the letters of Abelard and Eloise; the New Testament and Augustine’s The City of God.</span><br/>

First, to explore the close interaction between these two fields, and the way in which they have shaped each other through the ages. Second, to focus our attention on specific instances of art/science interaction, using them as prisms through which one can reach a fuller understanding of major historical transformations.</span><br/>

Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world. This class will explore how and why that came to happen. Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages</span><span class="deschide"> of players. We will locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity. The class will teach you both about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.</span><br/>

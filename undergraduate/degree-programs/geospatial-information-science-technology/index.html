				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Minor</h3>
<p>The minor in Geospatial Information Science and Technology (GIST) has been approved by three departments at UC Berkeley. The Departments of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management in the College of Natural Resources, City and Regional Planning in the College of Environmental Design, and Geography in the College of Letters &amp; Science offer minors in GIST which includes courses across campus. These programs serve students in geography and other social sciences, archaeology, environmental science, policy and management, city and regional planning, humanities, architecture, landscape architecture and environmental planning, civil and environmental engineering, public policy, and environmental public health. The minor is open to all majors at UC Berkeley.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Minor</h3>
<p>The Geospatial Information Science and Technology minor is available to any current UC Berkeley student in good academic standing. The deadline to complete this minor program is before your degree at UC Berkeley has posted. For more information, please visit <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/minors/gist">https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/minors/gist</a></p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/minors/gist" target="_blank">Visit Program Website</a></p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but they are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<p class="Default"><strong>Completing the Geospatial Information Science and Technology Minor Program</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li class="Default">All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process. </li>
	<li class="Default">Students must complete one required prerequisite and at least five upper division courses. At least three upper division courses must be selected from the restricted elective list.</li>
	<li class="Default">Students must check with their home college for overlap restrictions between majors and minors.</li>
	<li class="Default">All courses must be taken for a letter grade and the cumulative minor GPA must be 2.0 or higher.</li>
</ol>

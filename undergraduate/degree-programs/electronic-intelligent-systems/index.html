				<a name="degreerequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><h4>General Guidelines</h4>
<ol>
	<li>​All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before the EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before the EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of summer sessions. To declare the minor, contact the EECS department advisor for information on requirements and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be taken on a letter-graded basis.</li>
	<li>All upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor must be completed with an overall GPA of 2.0 or above.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used simultaneously to fulfill requirements for a student’s major and minor programs.</li>
	<li>Completion of the minor program must not delay a student’s graduation. </li>
	<li>EECS and L&amp;S CS majors may not pursue an EIS minor.</li>
	<li>All students must complete the EIS Minor Completion Form by the tenth week of their final semester.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p><span>Berkeley's undergraduate program in Architecture leads to the bachelor of arts (BA) degree. The program combines required courses in environmental design and architecture with opportunities for highly varied individual programs. Through its core courses, the program offers a broad introduction to the field of architecture, and through studies in the various areas it provides opportunities to prepare for specialization in the field in the areas of architectural design and representation; architectural technologies and building performance; and architectural history, society and culture. In addition to offering a sound and well-rounded education, undergraduate studies can also provide pre-professional competency for entry-level employment in architecture, the option for graduate work in architecture, or further studies in a related environmental design field.</span></p>
<p><span>Graduates go on to obtain professional degrees in architecture or in other related fields; many others work in architectural practice, construction, government, or industry. Employment opportunities exist also at the community level, particularly in those communities that traditionally have not been served by professional architectural practice. The overall aim of the undergraduate program is to establish a strong foundation for a range of careers and to provide for mobility and flexibility to suit changing individual opportunities.</span></p>
<h3><span>Course of Study Overview</span></h3>
<p><span>All undergraduates follow the same path through their junior year. In the first two years, students take a breadth of lower division courses and the introductory environmental design courses. The junior year is architecture-intensive. In the fall semester, students take a design studio and a history and humanities option. In the spring, the required courses include another studio, a course in history, and a technology option.</span></p>
<h3>Program Tracks</h3>
<p>During the spring semester of the junior year, students choose either a design research track or a studio track for the senior year.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Research Track: </strong><span>The</span> research track option explores a particular theme for both the fall and spring semesters of the senior year. This theme changes each year, and is taught by a group of faculty members on a subject of their shared interest. For the fall semester, students enroll in a project preparation seminar, and for the spring semester, students take a studio—led by the same faculty—in which they develop their research and explorations, culminating in a final project.</li>
	<li><strong>Studio Track:</strong> The studio track option is studio intensive, with more architecture courses required in addition to a design studio each semester. Studio track students enroll in a structures course in the fall, and choose between an energy and environment or construction course in the spring.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Accreditation/Licensure</h3>
<p>The BA degree is a preprofessional degree and provides the foundation for entry to a Master of Architecture program, the most widespread professional degree program in architecture in the United States. The BA degree can also be applied toward licensing requirements in the State of California. See the <a href="http://www.naab.org/" target="_blank">National Architectural Accrediting Board</a> (NAAB) for more information on accreditation. See the <a href="http://www.cab.ca.gov/" target="_blank">California Architects Board</a> and the <a href="http://www.ncarb.org/" target="_blank">National Council of Architectural Registration Boards</a> (NCARB) for more information on licensing.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Students must declare one of the CED majors at the time of application to the college; however, current UC Berkeley students may apply to change into CED. Transfer applicants must complete two years worth of lower division coursework to be considered for admission to CED. For information regarding admission to the major for freshman, transfer students, and current students who wish to change majors or colleges, please see the <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/2022-23/undergraduate/colleges-schools/environmental-design/#choosingamajortext">College of Environmental Design (CED) page</a> in this Guide, or the <a href="http://ced.berkeley.edu/admissions/undergraduate/" target="_blank">CED website</a>.</p>
<h3>Architecture Minor</h3>
<p><span>The Architecture minor introduces students to the conceptual, technical, and design aspects of architecture. </span>A letter grade of C- or higher is required in ENV DES 1 to declare the minor. To declare, students must submit the <a href="https://ced.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-advising/forms-documents/" target="_blank">CED Request to Add Minor Form</a>, available on the CED website. When completing the final requirements for the minor, submit the <a href="https://ced.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-advising/forms-documents/" target="_blank">CED Minor Completion Form</a>. <span>Other minors offered by the Department of Architecture are listed below:</span></p>

<h3><span>Undergraduate Student Learning Initiative (USLI)</span></h3>
<p>The Undergraduate Student Learning Initiative (USLI) is a campuswide initiative to support departments in establishing educational goals and evaluation procedures for all undergraduate programs. As a result of the initiative, faculty and students have a shared understanding of the purpose of the major and what graduating seniors are expected to know or to be able to do at the end of their course of study. The initiative is in keeping with the fundamental principle at Berkeley that the evaluation of student achievement should be locally defined, discipline specific, and faculty-driven.</p>
<h3>Department of Architecture Statement of Goals</h3>
<h4><span>The Underlying Goals of a Liberal Arts Undergraduate Education</span></h4>
<p><span>In its recent curriculum discussions, the faculty strongly supports a liberal arts education for undergraduates that teaches students to develop their intellectual capacities: how to research topics independently, how to ask penetrating questions, how to analyze problems, how to construct arguments based on critical thinking, how to make well-founded judgments, how to identify issues of importance for the future. The intent of the department is that all courses are framed with this perspective. In addition to this goal, the department is introducing students to the discipline specific areas of knowledge that are needed by students who apply for graduate school in architecture.</span></p>
<h4>The Discipline-Specific Knowledge of Architecture</h4>
<p><span>The discipline of architecture covers a wide range of discipline-specific subject areas that are integrated in the process of design.</span></p>
<p><span>The goal of the undergraduate major is to make students familiar with and curious about engagement in and production of the built environment in historical, critical, technical, and social dimensions. The possibilities open to graduates in the major are broad, and this challenges the department to locate the terrain that is common to various aspects of the discipline as a formulation of the core lower division courses, and then to offer at the upper division a set of “streams” of study, each of which inspires and prepares students to pursue a future endeavor. As these future endeavors cover a wide range of possibilities, there are several ways to view the undergraduate major: as a liberal arts education through the lens of architecture, perhaps leading to another course of study; as preparation for work in the profession with only an undergraduate degree; and as preparation for follow-up study at the graduate level in the discipline of architecture. Acceptance into strong graduate architecture programs requires a high level of proficiency in the core areas of the curriculum. In recent debates on the undergraduate curriculum, the faculty decided that the undergraduate major should continue to provide courses appropriate for students on each of these paths.</span></p>
<p>The curriculum exposes students to five aspects of architecture and the broader field of environmental design:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong><em>The Language of Architecture</em></strong><br/>
	In essence, the language most particular to architecture is a graphic vocabulary that is the currency of exploration in the design studio. The mastery of this language, like the learning of any language, begins with vocabulary and grammar, and then moves on to the construction of meaning. This latter aspect is rigorously pursued in the design studio, and for those planning to go on to graduate study in architecture, a number of these upper level studios offer an increasingly complex set of design challenges.<br/>
	In the Language of Architecture, students should learn to:
	<ul>
		<li>Understand the conventions of plan, section, elevation, and axonometric and their relationship to each other;</li>
		<li>Understand and become proficient in hand drawings and the use of digital media in the production of these conventions;</li>
		<li>Understand and become proficient in three or four digital programs that allow a facile exploration of design ideas;</li>
		<li>Become proficient in the production of design iterations; and</li>
		<li>Apply critical discussion to design solutions and representation.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong><em>The History and Theory of Architecture</em></strong><br/>
	Courses in history and theory are intended to familiarize students with the development of the built environment in both western and eastern traditions, and to introduce recent and current theories of local and global importance. The introductory surveys in architectural history test students to both recognize and classify architectural styles; these courses are complemented by others that focus on the intersection of history and theory, and for which the writing of papers is the primary means of evaluation.<br/>
	In the History and Theory of Architecture, students should learn to:
	<ul>
		<li>Articulate the theoretical concepts within the design studio projects;</li>
		<li>Understand the major periods and styles in architectural history;</li>
		<li>Understand the modern period, and its current debates; and</li>
		<li>Write critical papers comparing and contrasting both buildings and ideas.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong><em>The Humanistic Applications of Architecture</em></strong><br/>
	Many students enter this field of study in hopes of improving the conditions of the built environment as it relates to the daily life of individuals and communities. An emphasis in these aspects of the major can lead to graduate work in other disciplines, including environmental studies, law, global development and planning, and anthropology, or to a PhD program in architecture.<br/>
	In the Humanistic Applications of Architecture, students should learn to:
	<ul>
		<li>Understand the roles and responsibilities of the environmental professions;</li>
		<li>Understand the art and science of interpreting the social context of design;</li>
		<li>Identify the major issues of environmental design in the national and global setting; and</li>
		<li>Recognize the value of addressing sustainability at all levels of design.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong><em>The Science and Technology of Architecture</em></strong><br/>
	How buildings stand up, how they operate to distribute and control light and air, and the materials and connections with which they are made bring the understanding of the discipline from its paper representations of design and theory into the physical world. A set of core courses introduces students to the fundamentals of these areas, and a set of upper division seminars allows more in-depth explorations of aspects of each, including the testing of structural ideas through design, current attitudes and goals for a sustainable building culture, and construction practices particular to certain materials or cultures. <br/>
	In the Science and Technology of Architecture, student should learn to:
	<ul>
		<li>Evaluate building performance through modes of calculation;</li>
		<li>Familiarize themselves with the major groups of construction systems;</li>
		<li>Integrate these concepts into the design studio; and</li>
		<li>Familiarize themselves with the major debates in the literature of these areas.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong><em>Research Methods</em></strong><br/>
	Students should become proficient in the processes of academic research, learning to:
	<ul>
		<li>Undertake library and on-line research and follow source threads to both books and periodicals;</li>
		<li>Construct bibliographies to academic standards;</li>
		<li>Document various methods of research; and</li>
		<li>Understand taxonomies of knowledge and organize information.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

How do buildings form and inform the ways in which we live — as individuals and as part of different communities? This course explores the multiple ways in which people and buildings interact.

This class introduces students to the history and practice of design theory from the late 19th century to the present, with emphasis on developments of the last four decades. Readings and lectures explore specific constellations of theory and practice in relation to changing social and historical conditions. The course follows the rise of modernist design thinking, with particular emphasis on the growing influence of technical rationality across</span><span class="deschide"> multiple fields in the post World War II period. Systematic approaches based in cybernetics and operations research (amongst others) are examined in the context of wider attempts to develop a science of design. Challenges to modernist design thinking, through advocacy planning and community-based design, the influence of social movements and countercultures, and parallel developments in postmodernism within and beyond architecture, provide the critical background for consideration of recent approaches to design theory, including those informed by developments in digital media and technology, environmental and ecological concerns, questions surrounding the globalization of architectural production, and the development of new materials.</span><br/>

This seminar examines the relationship between architecture and the processes associated with globalization. The social and spatial changes connected to the global economic restructuring of the last four decades are explored in relation to disctinctive national conditions and their connection to historical forces such as colonization and imperialism. Theoretical arguments about international urban political economy, uneven development, deindustrialization</span><span class="deschide">, and the growth of tourism and service industries, are grounded in specific urban and architectural contexts. Case studies explore issues such as urban entrepreneurialism and the branding of cities and nationstates; heritage practices and the postcolonial politics of place; border cities, and the urbanism of transnational production; cities, terrorism, and the global architecture of security; critical regionalism, localism, and other responses to debates on place and placelessness. Readings and class discussions examine course themes in a comparative framework and consider their implications for architectural design, education, and professional practice.</span><br/>

The concept of space as it is applied to the fields of architecture, geography and urbanism can be understood as a barometer of the condition that we call &quot;modernity.&quot; This course explores connections between the larger cultural frameworks of the past century, and the idea of space as it has been perceived, conceived and lived during this period. Readings include essays from the disciplines of philosophy, geography, architecture</span><span class="deschide">, landscape, and urbanism, and short works of fiction that illustrate and elucidate the spatial concepts.

In profound buildings, the structural system, construction materials, and architectural form work together to create an integrated work of art. Current practice segregates these three areas by assigning separate and rigid roles to 1) an engineer, 2) a contractor, and 3) an architect. The goal of this class is to blur these traditional boundaries and erase the intellectual cleft though hands-on experience. Students are given weekly assignments which focus on one or more</span><span class="deschide"> of the three areas. They may be asked to analyze a structure, to construct something from actual materials, or research a case study and present it to the class. Each assignment to geared to help students integrate construction and structural issues into their architectural design, so that they can maintain control of the entire design process.</span><br/>

This introduction to the materials and processes of construction takes architecture from design to realization. The course will cover four material groups commonly used in two areas of the building assembly (structure and envelope): wood, concrete, steel, and glass. You will understand choices available and how materials are conventionally used. By observing construction, you'll see how our decisions affect the size of materials, connections</span><span class="deschide">, and where they are assembled. Architects must understand not only conventions, but also the potential in materials, so we will also study unusual and new developments.</span><br/>

This course examines developments in design, theory, graphic representation, construction technology, and interior programming through case studies of individual buildings. Our survey technique will be highly focused rather than panoptic. Each lecture will delve deeply into one or two buildings to examine program, spatial organization, graphic representation, critical building details, construction technology, and the relationship of the case study</span><span class="deschide"> building with regard to other contemporary structures and the architect's overall body of work. From this nucleus, we will spiral outward to consider how the case study is embedded within a constellation of social and economic factors crucial to its design and physical realization. This survey of &quot;modernism's built discourses&quot; provides multiple perspectives on the variety of architectural propositions advanced to express the nature of modernity as a way of life.</span><br/>

The Great Depression and World War II are arguably the two most influential events for the development of the built environment in the 20th century. Not only did they alter the socio-economic and political landscape on which architecture and urban planning depend, but they also led to technological innovations and vital debates about the built environment. This course examines the 1930's and 1940's topically, studying the work of the New Deal, corporate responses</span><span class="deschide"> to the Depression and war, the important connections between architecture and advertising, the role of the Museum of Modern Art in the promotion of Modernism, the concept of the ideal house, and key tests, theories, and projects from the period.</span><br/>

This seminar provides an introduction to architectural theory since 1945, with emphasis on developments over the last three decades. Class readings and discussions explore the post-World War II crisis within modernism, postmodernism within and beyond architectural culture, and more recent developments around issues such as rapid urbanization, sustainability, the politics of cultural identity, and globalization. Transformations in architectural theory are examined</span><span class="deschide"> in relation to historical forces such as the economy, the growth and transformation of cities, and the changing relationship between design professions and disciplines. The influences of digital media, new materials and production techniques on architectural education and practice are explored and the implications for architectural theory assessed.

The first half of this course surveys American architecture from Colonial times to contemporary trends. Stylistic and spatial analysis is linked with the socioeconomic, political, and environmental influences on architecture, issues on originality, American exceptionalism, the influence from abroad, regionalism, and the role of technology. The second half delves more deeply into the history of specific building types--house, church, museum, library--grafting the earlier</span><span class="deschide"> themes onto a history of modern institutions as they took shape in the United States.</span><br/>

Many California architects came from other places: Maybeck from New York via the<br/>
Ecole des Beaux Arts; Schindler and Neutra from Vienna; Frank Gehry from Chicago.<br/>
But, once they arrived, their encounters with the Golden State produced new and original<br/>
forms of architecture. This seminar will examine the qualities of the state’s environment,<br/>
culture, economy, and population that have produced unique buildings and landscapes<br/>
during</span><span class="deschide"> the 20th century. It will look at both Northern and Southern California architecture,<br/>
starting with canonical designers then moving beyond them to consider lesser-known<br/>
regional architects whose work embodies local characteristics.</span><br/>

This course explores architectural visions as historical windows, examining them from a number of angles. Using a variety of case studies drawn from different media (architectural theory, film, advertisements, architectural projects, and so on) and periods (turn of the century, the Modern Movement, Depression, World War II, 1960's, etc,) it provides a sampling of possibilities and models for the final student project, an in-depth, original research paper. Several</span><span class="deschide"> themes thread their way through the course, including the role of the &quot;unbuilt&quot; in architectural practice; the uses of the future in the construction of national and personal identities, cultural narratives, and modern mythologies; and the importance of the future as cliche, and the role of play in cultural production.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p><span style="font-family:freight-sans-pro; font-size:1em; font-weight:500">The Education minor offers an opportunity for intellectual inquiry to broaden and complement students' work in their major fields of study. In the process, students will encounter a wide array of professional possibilities in the field of education, enabling those considering a career in the field to make an informed choice.</span></p>
<h3>Applying to the Minor</h3>
<p>In order to apply to the Education minor, students must:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Attend one of the <a href="http://gse.berkeley.edu/undergraduate-programs-undergraduate-minor-education-information-sessions">Education Minor Information Sessions</a>. These sessions, conducted by the Education Minor adviser, give background information about the minor, review requirements and guidelines, and answer questions. Information sessions are held several times during the fall and spring semesters and last from half an hour to an hour. If students are unable to attend the information sessions, they are welcome to meet with the minor advisor during office hours.</li>
	<li>Submit an online application form, available on the <a href="https://gse.berkeley.edu/undergraduate-programs-undergraduate-minor-education-applying">School of Education website</a>. Apply only after attending an information session or meeting with the Education Minor adviser. When completing the online application form, students will be asked to provide a list of courses and fieldwork they have already taken and/or plan to take to complete the requirements of the minor. This is only a plan. Students will not be required to take or use those courses for the minor.</li>
</ol>
<p>After submitting the online application, the minor adviser will automatically be notified and will review your application for completeness. Unless there are questions, the student will then be considered an Education Minor candidate. The student's email address will be added to the education minor email list so the student can be notified of opportunities in the field of education, as well as Education Minor program and course updates.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://gse.berkeley.edu/other/undergraduate-minor" target="_blank">Visit School Website</a></p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript, but they are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed before your degree date.</li>
	<li>All course work to satisfy the minor requirements must be taken at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>Three of the five required courses for the minor must be upper division. </li>
	<li>All courses used to fulfill the minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade, with the exception of the field work course(s).</li>
	<li>A minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>One Education Minor course may overlap with a student's major or other minor.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Fieldwork</h3>
<p>There are 2 main options for completing fieldwork:</p>
<p>(1) <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=EDUC%20197" title="EDUC 197" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'EDUC 197');">EDUC 197</a></span>, Field Studies, includes a number of programs from which to choose. <span>Please consult the list available on the </span><a href="https://gse.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/undergraduate-minor-education/requirements" target="_blank">School of Education website</a><span>. All of the sections of </span><span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=EDUC%20197" title="EDUC 197" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'EDUC 197');">EDUC 197</a></span><span> are described in the Quicklist and Descriptions PDF available on the </span><a href="https://gse.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/undergraduate-minor-education/requirements" target="_blank">School of Education website</a><span>.  To obtain the class number for the program/section in which you are interested, contact the site coordinator for that program.  45 hours of fieldwork per semester is equivalent to 1 academic unit.</span></p>
<p>(2) <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=EDUC%20W144" title="EDUC W144" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'EDUC W144');">EDUC W144</a></span>, Practicum in Education, our web-based field course,<span class="PSLONGEDITBOX" id="DERIVED_CLSRCH_DESCRLONG"> serves the Ed Minor mission of developing students’ critical habits of mind and reflection in educational research and practice. </span></p>
<p>Students may enroll in 1, 2 or 3 units of fieldwork within one semester and may take units over multiple semesters.  Students may take all 3 units in the same field studies program or may enroll in two or three separate programs.</p>
<h3>Electives</h3>
<p>Elective courses must be taken for at least 3 units.</p>
<p>A maximum of two graduate-level courses in education may be used to meet the elective requirement.</p>
<p>Students who have completed or plan to complete an education course as part of a UCB Education Abroad program may be able to have it count toward the education minor elective requirement. The course must be in the Department of Education at the University and equivalent to 3 semester credits. Notify the minor adviser if you would like to take advantage of this option.</p>
<p>From time to time, a course may be offered on campus that has significant educational content but is not on the minor approved course list. If you have found such a course and would like to have it considered for one of your electives for the minor, please contact the minor advisor about petitioning the course. A syllabus will be required.</p>

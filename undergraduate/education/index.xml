<h3>Applying for Admission</h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-94170102-7fff-0a7c-2c8c-18b423136f7b">UC Berkeley is among the more selective universities in the country; far more students apply than can be offered admission. For fall 2022, Berkeley admitted over 15,000 students of over 128,000 freshman applicants and approximately 4,800 of over 19,000 transfer applicants. UC Berkeley's applicant pool is increasingly more competitive with each passing year. As such, competitive candidates will present academic profiles that far exceed the minimum requirements for admission to the University of California.</span></p>

<h4>Additional Information Regarding Requirements</h4>
<p>In addition, applicants who are residents of California will be offered admission somewhere in the UC system if space is available, and they:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Rank in the top 9% of all high school graduates statewide (according the <a href="http://universityofcalifornia.edu/admissions/freshman/california-residents/admissions-index/index.html">UC admissions index</a>); or</li>
	<li>Rank in the top 9% of their graduating class at a participating high school. This is also referred to as &quot;Eligibility of the Local Context (ELC).&quot;</li>
</ol>
<h4>Eligibility in the Local Context</h4>
<p>If you rank in the top 9% of students in your California high school class — and your high school participates in our Eligibility in the Local Context (ELC) program — you may be eligible for the ELC designation.</p>
<p>We will identify the top 9% of students on the basis of GPA in UC-approved coursework completed in the 10th and 11th grades. To be considered for ELC, you must have a minimum GPA of 3.0 and complete the following &quot;a-g&quot; courses prior to your senior year:</p>
<ul>
	<li>History/Social Science: 1 year</li>
	<li>English: 2 years</li>
	<li>Mathematics: 2 years</li>
	<li>Laboratory Science: 1 year</li>
	<li>Language other than English: 1 year</li>
	<li>College-preparatory elective (chosen from the subjects listed above or in another course approved by the University): 4 year-long courses or equivalent</li>
</ul>
<p>After you enter your coursework and grades in your application, we'll compare your GPA to the historic top GPA for your school. If you meet or exceed that GPA, you'll be designated ELC and we'll add a note to your application. Applications from California will be automatically screened for ELC eligibility when they are submitted.</p>

<h4>Freshman Selection</h4>
<p>All achievement — both academic and non-academic/personal — is considered in the context of your educational circumstances, with an emphasis on the opportunities or challenges presented to you and your response to them. No single attribute or characteristic guarantees the admission of any applicant to Berkeley.</p>

<h3>Admission of International Applicants</h3>
<p>You are an international applicant if a visa is required to reside and study in the United States. A US citizen, permanent resident, refugee, or asylee who currently lives and studies outside the US is considered a domestic applicant with foreign credentials. International students in the US on a visa cannot be classified as California residents for tuition purposes.</p>
<p>Learn more by clicking <a href="http://admissions.berkeley.edu/internationalstudents">here</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Admission as a Transfer Student</h3>
<p>You are a transfer student if you have completed coursework during a regular session at a college or university after high school. (The summer session immediately following high school graduation does not count.) While UC gives California community college students first priority over other transfer applicants, we also accept those from four-year institutions.</p>
<p>You can find more information concerning general transfer admission requirements to the University of California system online <a href="http://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/transfer/preparing-admission/minimum-requirements/index.html">here</a>. For specific information on preparing to transfer to Berkeley, see the announcements of the individual colleges and schools. You can also obtain information online <a href="http://admissions.berkeley.edu/transferstudents">here</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Minimum Admission Requirements for Transfer Students</h4>
<h5>Requirements for California Residents</h5>
<p>Most transfer students enter UC at the junior level. This means that they have completed 60 semester units, general education, and most, if not all, of their lower division major prerequisites.</p>
<p>We review all information, both academic and non-academic/personal, in the context of each student's individual circumstances. To be competitive, present an academic profile with strong grades that includes preparation for your intended major/college.</p>
<p>Most programs will not offer admission to students with excess units, i.e., more than 80 UC transferable semester units before enrollment. </p>
<ul>
	<li>If <em>all</em> coursework was completed at a two-year college, <em>this excess unit policy does not apply</em>.</li>
	<li>All coursework from a two-year college is considered lower division.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obtain information on all requirements on <a href="http://www.assist.org">ASSIST</a>. ASSIST lists Berkeley requirements and the California community college courses approved as satisfying those requirements. If you are applying from a school other than a California community college, select &quot;UC Berkeley&quot; and then any community college from the pull-down menu on ASSIST. You will then have access to Berkeley requirements; take comparable courses at your school.</p>
<h5>Requirements for Non-Residents</h5>
<p>The minimum eligibility requirements for non-resident transfer applicants are the same as those for residents except that non-residents must have a GPA of 3.0 or higher in all transferable college coursework.</p>
<h5>Transfers from Other UC Campuses</h5>
<p>After you enroll at a UC campus, it may be possible for you to transfer to another UC campus. Applications for intercampus transfer are considered in light of your personal circumstances and the availability of space in your prospective major. These students must apply as junior transfers with 60-89 semester/90-134 quarter units.</p>
<p>If you wish to transfer from one UC campus to another, you must submit an application for undergraduate admission during the appropriate filing period.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Transfer Selection</h4>
<p>The campus selects its transfer class primarily on the basis of academic performance and preparation, as assessed by a review of GPA and completion of lower division prerequisite courses for the intended major and breadth requirements.</p>
<p>We also consider:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Grade trends</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Demonstrated interest in the major, an important consideration for all applicants</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Personal qualities such as leadership or motivation</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Extracurricular accomplishments</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Employment</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Potential contribution to the intellectual and cultural vitality of the campus</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h3>Readmission</h3>
<p>You must file an &quot;Undergraduate Application for Readmission&quot; if you are an applicant who:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Formally withdrew from the University</li>
	<li>Were absent for one or more semesters</li>
	<li>Are returning to Berkeley as a limited-status student</li>
</ul>
<p>For further information, including deadlines; fee information; and copies of the required application, please see the <a href="http://registrar.berkeley.edu/current_students/readmission.html">Readmission page</a> on the Office of the Registrar's website.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Limited Status</h3>
<p>Limited status students are a special category of undergraduates who have earned an undergraduate degree with a record of superior scholarship (an overall GPA of at least 3.3) but need additional undergraduate coursework for a specific and clearly defined purpose. Currently, only the College of Chemistry will consider admitting students in limited status.</p>
<p>Limited status is granted only in special circumstances; students' needs, abilities, and programs should have enough urgency to justify admitting them in place of students in regular status, and there should be no reasonable alternative available. Use of limited status to enable students to raise their scholarship average is not permitted.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Working Toward a Second Bachelor's Degree</h3>
<p>Currently, only the College of Chemistry will consider admitting students for a second bachelor's degree for the Chemistry and Chemical Biology majors.</p>
<p>In practice, Berkeley admits very few students to the Limited Status or second bachelor's programs each year. If you are not eligible for the second bachelor's or the limited status programs, you may consider concurrent enrollment through UC Berkeley Extension as an alternative. For further information on concurrent enrollment, please see the <a href="https://extension.berkeley.edu/static/studentservices/concurrent/">UC Berkeley Extension website</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>Campus Requirements</strong></h3>
<h4>Berkeley Campus American Cultures Breadth Requirement</h4>
 <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-c47924ad-7fff-1b30-99f8-3c345cb2b997">The American Cultures requirement is a Berkeley campus requirement, one that all undergraduate students at Berkeley need to pass in order to graduate. You satisfy the requirement by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, an American Cultures course. You may take an American Cultures course any time during your undergraduate career at Berkeley. The requirement was instituted in 1991 to introduce students to the diverse cultures of the United States through a comparative framework. Courses are offered in more than fifty departments in many different disciplines at both the lower and upper division level.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-c47924ad-7fff-1b30-99f8-3c345cb2b997">The American Cultures requirement and courses constitute an approach that responds directly to the problem encountered in numerous disciplines of how better to present the diversity of American experience to the diversity of American students whom we now educate.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-c47924ad-7fff-1b30-99f8-3c345cb2b997">Faculty members from many departments teach American Cultures courses, but all courses have a common framework. The courses focus on themes or issues in United States history, society, or culture; address theoretical or analytical issues relevant to understanding race, culture, and ethnicity in American society; take substantial account of groups drawn from at least three of the following: African Americans, indigenous peoples of the United States, Asian Americans, Chicano/Latino Americans, and European Americans; and are integrative and comparative in that students study each group in the larger context of American society, history, or culture.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-c47924ad-7fff-1b30-99f8-3c345cb2b997">This is not an ethnic studies requirement, nor a Third World cultures requirement, nor an adjusted Western civilization requirement. These courses focus upon how the diversity of America's constituent cultural traditions have shaped and continue to shape American identity and experience.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-c47924ad-7fff-1b30-99f8-3c345cb2b997">Visit the </span><a href="http://classes.berkeley.edu/">Class Schedule</a> or the <a href="http://americancultures.berkeley.edu/">American Cultures website</a> for the specific American Cultures courses offered each semester. For a complete list of approved American Cultures courses at UC Berkeley and California Community Colleges, please see the <a href="https://academic-senate.berkeley.edu/committees/amcult">American Cultures Subcommittee’s website</a>. See your academic adviser if you have questions about your responsibility to satisfy the American Cultures breadth requirement.</p>

<h3>College Requirements</h3>
<h4>College and School Requirements</h4>
<p>Each college and school has established a program of requirements for the degree, which may be in addition to those of a field of concentration. These requirements may include: (1) preparatory subject requirements for admission; (2) preparatory college-level courses for your particular field of study — to be completed, if possible, during your early period of residency in the college or school, or in some cases before entrance; (3) breadth requirements, courses outside the field of study, considered essential to a well-rounded curriculum; (4) the credit requirement, which is the total number of units to be completed, with specifications of how these credits are to be distributed; and (5) a minimum scholarship requirement.</p>

<h4>Reading and Composition Requirement</h4>
<p>The Berkeley campus is strongly committed to developing high levels of ability in critical thinking and communication among its undergraduates. Many Berkeley courses require long papers and a number of courses provide training in writing or speaking. In addition to the University-wide Entry Level Writing requirement, the College of Letters &amp; Science and most other colleges and schools require two semesters of lower division work in composition, to be completed by the end of the sophomore year. </p>
<h4>Academic<span id="docs-internal-guid-34bc41ec-7fff-53ab-f2ee-d77b223e4d94"> Status (Good Standing, Probation, Subject to Dismissal)</span></h4>

Since academic status rules are applied only at the end of fall or spring semesters, grade points that are earned in a University of California summer session or by removing an Incomplete grade are not taken into consideration until the end of your next fall or spring semester of attendance.</p>

<h4>Senior Residence Requirement</h4>
<p>After you have completed 90 units toward the bachelor's degree, you must complete at least 24 of the remaining units in residence in no fewer than two semesters in the college or school in which you will take your degree. You must begin these final 24 units in the semester in which you exceed 90 units.</p>

<h4>Departmental Requirements</h4>
<p>Every student must select a field of concentration and pursue a major or curriculum, normally by taking a minimum number of units in one department or school. Occasionally, as with Business Administration, the school and the department are synonymous. In some cases, a major may embrace more than one department, as with the interdisciplinary studies field major in the College of Letters &amp; Science.</p>
<h4>Major Requirements</h4>
<p>Major requirements that must be fulfilled before you may receive a baccalaureate degree are outlined in each program in the<a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/2022-23/undergraduate/degree-programs/"> Degree Programs: Major &amp; Minors</a> section of this Guide. Please also, see your department adviser.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Planning for and Declaring a Major</h3>
<p>Your major is your opportunity to study a discipline or interdisciplinary area in depth, so be sure to choose a major you are passionate about. UC Berkeley offers an astonishing range of major programs. You can use this Guide as a starting point to learn about the options available to you. Advisers in your college and in the departments you are considering will also be an invaluable resource to you as you weigh and explore your options.</p>
<p>In some colleges, students are admitted directly into a major program. If you have been admitted as an undeclared student, view your first year as a time of exploration. Do not choose your major prematurely: many of the fields taught at Berkeley will be unfamiliar to you, so there is no way anyone would reasonably expect you to choose one as soon as you arrive. Try courses in a variety of fields that tempt you, and look for the discipline that asks and answers the kinds of questions you find most vital and compelling.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on the lower division prerequisites for all of the majors of possible interest, so you can build them in to your class schedule for the first two years where possible. Be on the lookout for courses that are prerequisite to more than one major of possible interest to you. But also remain open to the possibility that a course you are taking just for breadth credit may lead you unexpectedly to a major that you find rewarding and compelling.</p>
<p>Some majors are capped: they cannot accommodate all interested students. If you are drawn to a capped major, it is particularly important to consult with the major adviser early on to maximize your chances of being chosen, and to have a non-capped major in mind as a second option.</p>
<p>Regulations and procedures for declaring the major, or changing your major, vary by college. In general, you will be expected to choose a major by the end of your sophomore year.</p>
<h4>Declaration and Change of Major</h4>
<p>Regulations and procedures for declaring the major vary for each college. You may, at any time up to the last semester of residence, file a petition for a change of major. (<em>Note: This policy does not apply to students in the College of Engineering. If you are in the College of Engineering, you must file your petition for a change of major no later than the end of your fourth semester. Transfer students or students who changed into the College of Engineering are not eligible to change their major.</em>) You must secure approval for this action from the dean or another authorized person in the college or department to which you are transferring.</p>
<h4>Preparation for Graduate Study</h4>
<p>If you are preparing for study toward a higher degree, you should learn, as early as possible, the entrance and degree requirements of your graduate field, in order to include all prerequisite steps in your undergraduate program.</p>

<h3>Freshman and Sophomore Seminars</h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-a59cae8a-7fff-05b3-12cb-628ec487d9b5"><a href="https://fss.berkeley.edu/">Freshman and Sophomore Seminars</a> arose from the conviction that early intellectual contact with faculty members would greatly enhance the undergraduate experience at Berkeley. Professors from nearly every campus department join together each semester to offer an impressive array of seminars. The courses numbered 24 (and in some cases 90) bear one unit of credit; they are limited to 15 students and freshmen are given priority for enrollment. The courses numbered 84 bear one or two units of credit; they are limited to 15 sophomores. The courses numbered 39A-39Z are limited to 25 freshmen and sophomores.</span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-a59cae8a-7fff-05b3-12cb-628ec487d9b5">Seminars, which emphasize interaction and discussion, provide a counterpoint to the learning experience in Berkeley’s large lecture halls. These seminars also offer lower-division students an unprecedented opportunity to explore a wide range of majors and even fields of study usually reserved for graduate students. As you browse through this Guide</span>, you will find lower-division seminars sponsored by Letters and Science departments, as well as by the professional schools and colleges.</p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-a59cae8a-7fff-05b3-12cb-628ec487d9b5">Descriptions of all the seminars scheduled for the upcoming semester can be found in time for course enrollment registration on the </span><a href="http://fss.berkeley.edu/">program’s website</a>, which also contains other useful information and features for undergraduates.

<h3>Studying Abroad</h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-b5ddf46e-7fff-68b3-3c87-4fe278cf755c">Berkeley Study Abroad (BSA) offers a broad spectrum of opportunities for students to gain first-hand experience living among other cultures while progressing toward their degrees and gaining professional experience. Choose from a diverse array of programs across all the major disciplines in more than 40 countries, including the UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP), Berkeley Summer Abroad, and Berkeley Global Internships programs. Students earn University credit for their participation while enhancing their undergraduate experience. Students can also consider studying abroad to avoid some impacted classes on campus. Options include semester, year-long, and summer programs. Many programs do not require foreign language proficiency. Financial Aid recipients qualify for financial aid assistance while abroad on BSA programs, and scholarships are available for BSA students with financial need. Contact your college advisor to find out how you can fulfill breadth requirements while studying abroad.</span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-b5ddf46e-7fff-68b3-3c87-4fe278cf755c">For further information, visit the </span><a href="http://studyabroad.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Study Abroad website </a>and speak with a Study Abroad Advisor.</p>
<h4><strong><span>Programs Not Sponsored by the University of California</span></strong></h4>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-def0c062-7fff-d69e-b802-3ef370ce396c">Many Berkeley undergraduates choose to attend overseas study programs sponsored by institutions and organizations other than the University of California. To obtain information about these programs, you should contact the programs directly. Berkeley Study Abroad (BSA) offers </span><a href="https://myapp.berkeley.edu/independent.pdf">information on how to participate in non-UC study abroad programs</a>. Additionally, most students will be eligible for an approved leave of absence and access to most study systems while abroad by completing the process of Planned Leave for Study Abroad. To complete the process, students must submit a Planned Leave for Study Abroad Form directly to the BSA office by the established campus deadline before beginning the non-UC study abroad program. Credit for coursework completed is dependent on a review of your final transcript by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.  Before enrolling in any program, your proposed coursework will need to be reviewed by the Central Evaluation Unit (CEU) to determine the transferability of coursework from a particular program. Finally, consult with a college and major adviser as to the appropriateness of your proposed courses toward degree progress and, if necessary, procedures for readmission.</p>

 <p>Every year, the Berkeley campus honors several of its outstanding faculty members by presenting them with the <a href="http://teaching.berkeley.edu/programs/distinguished-teaching-award">Distinguished Teaching Award.</a> More than 250 faculty members from all over campus have been recognized this way for their outstanding teaching. If you see a plus (+) before a faculty member's name, this means they are a recipient of the Distinguished Teaching Award.</p> <p>At a large institution often known more for its research, such recognition serves to remind us all of the importance of teaching and the value we place on it. Students who attend Berkeley have the benefit of learning from world-renowned theorists and researchers who are also often distinguished teachers. Recipients of past awards have pointed out that their research is often enhanced by the questions and responses of their students in the classroom, while at the same time, the excitement of generating new ideas and discoveries in research stimulates them to become better teachers.</p> <p>Good teachers do more than convey knowledge in a field. They clarify for students the relationships between their subject and other fields of knowledge; they ignite in their students a desire to learn; and as a consequence, they often have a life-long impact on their students’ lives and careers.</p> <p>Good teaching is, of course, not limited to the people who have received the Distinguished Teaching Award. You will encounter excellent teachers in all departments, all disciplines, in large classes and in seminars. There is no one way to teach well; the styles you will encounter will be as varied as the courses you take, from eye-opening lectures to discussion sections in which you will clarify and define your own ideas. In teaching, as in every aspect of UC Berkeley, diversity is the key to a rich and challenging educational experience.</p>

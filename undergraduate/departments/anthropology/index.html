<h2>Overview</h2>




<p>The Department of Anthropology offers students the opportunity to study humankind from the broadest historical and geographical perspective. Courses in the department offer knowledge of social and cultural aspects of behavior, as well as the physical nature of humans. Lower division courses are intended to give a general understanding of human evolution, prehistory, and the nature of human cultures, while upper division courses elaborate particular themes.</p>




<p>The collections and research facilities of the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology are available for study in archaeology, ethnography, physical anthropology, and related subjects by graduate and undergraduate students, and visiting scholars. The museum's exhibition hall is used for instructional and educational purposes, particularly in connection with classwork. Those interested may address the Director at 103 Anthropology and Art Practice Building.</p>




<p>Students seeking information on the Undergraduate Program may inquire at 215 Anthropology and Art Practice Building. Students seeking information on the Graduate Program may inquire at 213 Anthropology and Art Practice Building.</p>

Humans have always been affected by changes in their landscape and, in turn, had an influence on their physical surroundings. The contexts that archaeological material and features are found within yield invaluable clues as to how sites form, what types of activities people performed in them, and what kinds of natural and cultural processes altered the archaeological record from deposition to excavation. This course introduces the methods of</span><span class="deschide"> studying archaeological remains from an environmental context in order to reconstruct the relationships between people and the environment, drawing on case studies from different areas of the world.</span><br/>

In the contemporary world, different systems of knowledge, philosophies, and techniques of the self, understandings of normality and pathology, illness and healing, are increasingly engaged in a dialogue with each other in the lives, on the bodies, and in the imagination of people. The terms of this dialogue are often unequal and painful, yet they are also productive of new subjectivities and new voices. It is the task of a renewed psychological</span><span class="deschide"> anthropology to study and reflect on these processes. Topics to be covered in this class include new forms of the subject and ethics at the intersection of psychical/psychiatric, political, and religious processes and discources; ethno-psychiatry, psychoanalysis, the psychology of colonization and racism; anthropological approaches to possession and altered states, emotion, culture, and the imagination, madness and mental illness. The specific stress will be on the stakes of anthropology of the psyche today, for an understanding of power and subjugation, delusion and the imagination, violence, and the possibility of new forms of life.</span><br/>

Disability is a cultural construct. This does not mean that physical and mental impairments are not real, but that our conceptions of the body and its possibilities and impossibilities are constantly mediated through social norms and mores. The built environments and social institutions we navigate are based around these concepts of the “normal.” Using ethnographic examples drawn from various countries around the world, and various disability</span><span class="deschide"> categories, we examine the contingency of the categories of disability and normality from social, legal, and personal perspectives.</span><br/>

This course provides an advanced introduction to key conceptual work in the anthropology of science, technology, and knowledge production. The course examines how truth-effects are produced in the world, and how people know what we know. It explores the social and political arrangements “built into” or materialized through the infrastructures and objects that help structure lives in the U.S. and globally. It asks how new information technology, media platforms</span><span class="deschide">, and data-rich practices change the questions of knowledge and truth. It examines such things as life by algorithm, data mining, the self-tracking movement (especially vis-à-vis health), and the infrastructures of “the cloud”.</span><br/>

This course highlights Southeast Asia as an important region for the study of politics and power from an anthropological perspective. It sheds light on how notions of “power” stemming from the unique political histories of Southeast Asia might help us rethink its role in governmentality, knowledge-producing practices, and in creating the conditions for political legitimacy. We will examine how various forces shaped what power came to be in</span><span class="deschide"> time and place. We will examine how this legacy continues in terms of patron-client networks, the meaning of political legitimacy, and ways of seeing sex and gender.</span><br/>

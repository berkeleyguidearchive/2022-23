<h2>Overview</h2>




<p>The Cognitive Science Program at UC Berkeley offers undergraduates the opportunity to explore the mind from an interdisciplinary perspective. Courses in the program draw on psychology, linguistics, computer science, philosophy, neuroscience, and anthropology, among other fields, to illuminate how the human mind works and why it works the way it does.</p>




<p>Many influential ideas within cognitive science originated at Berkeley. The program draws on over 40 affiliated faculty from a variety of departments and is closely integrated with cognitive science research efforts across the campus.</p>




<p>The cognitive science research community at Berkeley is centered around the <a href="http://icbs.berkeley.edu/">Institute of Cognitive and Brain Sciences</a>. Students interested in cognitive science graduate study can receive graduate training in programs in affiliated disciplines, e.g. <a href="http://psychology.berkeley.edu/">psychology</a>, <a href="http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/">linguistics</a>, <a href="http://neuroscience.berkeley.edu/">neuroscience</a>. There is presently no separate graduate program specifically for cognitive science. </p>

This class will explore language and the psychological and neurological processing related to language, language use, and cognition from the multidisciplinary perspective of cognitive science.

The psychological and neurological processing related to language helps to show the nature of the human mind in comparison to others, the unique variety of cognition that language serves, and the relation of that type of cognition to other types. This not only helps to reveal various forms of cognition but also how those forms relate in human, as well as non-human, minds. To do this we will ask:<br/>
1) What is language as a system and behavior of humankind?<br/>
2) Where is the knowledge of language from?<br/>
3) How is language acquired, processed, and lost in the human brain?<br/>
4) What do the empirical results and the history of linguistic studies that we cover reveal about how we think about language and, by implication, human beings themselves.<br/></p></div>

Becoming proficient with this literature will help students understand the current state of the field so that they can evaluate strengths and weaknesses of different views about slurs and stereotypes, formulate new research questions, and develop original ideas for further studying<br/>
slurs and stereotypes on their own. By reading original articles about slurs and stereotypes from different subfields of cognitive science, including linguistics, psychology, philosophy, and cognitive neuroscience, students will also improve their ability to evaluate and prepare arguments, understand experimental design, collect data, read tables and figures, and interpret results. By completing two quizzes over the course of the semester, students will gain a foundational understanding about the literature on slurs and stereotypes.<br/></p></div>

Humans across all time periods and cultures have engaged in musical and linguistic activity, but why do all humans engage in these two peculiar kinds of complex behaviors? The purpose of this course is to introduce students to embodied, cognitive perspectives on music and language through the study of a range of topics about music and language including jazz improvisation, the evolution of rhythm processing, and birdsong, to name a few. By completing</span><span class="deschide"> this course students will gain insight into one of the most fascinating areas of research in cognitive science today and build an understanding of the central roles that music and language play in our mental and social life.</span><br/>

When something &quot;makes sense” or &quot; is organized” we are imposing or discovering order in the arrangement of concepts, events, or resources of some kind.

We will analyze sensemaking and organizing from</span><span class="deschide"> four interrelated perspectives.

Cognitive Neuroscience has provided a paradigm shift in our understanding of brain structure and function. We have excitingly transitioned from a scientific approach to brain science that relied primarily on overt behavioral observation and making anatomical inferences based on those behaviors to probing the brain in ways that were once considered inconceivable. Scientific and technology (imaging) developments now enable neuroscientists to view, investigate, measure</span><span class="deschide">, and influence the brain directly. An understanding of both structure and function then advances our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in cognitive processes underlying neural systems. For instance, what brain structures are involved, connected and work in concert to form new</span><br/>

This class is on the cognitive unconsciousness. This is the unconscious mind from a cognitive science point of view rather than one from psychoanalysis (though we will briefly touch on the psychoanalytic notions of the unconscious to clarify the distinction). The basic guide will be asking whether there is explanatory value to explaining human behavior with mental states or events that are not conscious to the person who has them. We say, for</span><span class="deschide"> example, that a person flinched because they felt pain. Pain is a mental state that can explain the behavior (the flinch) of the person.

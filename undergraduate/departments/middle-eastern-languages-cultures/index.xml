The department offers specialized training in archaeology, art history, Assyriology, Egyptology, Iranian studies, Judaic studies, Islamic studies, comparative Semitics, and Turkish, Hebrew, Arabic, and Persian languages and literature. Students can explore the interconnected worlds of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and their neighbors, as well as the modern literature and diverse cultures and societies of the modern Middle East. Students are given the opportunity to participate in a discovery experience that is innovative, collaborative, transdisciplinary, and features digital research.</p>
<h3>Undergraduate Programs</h3>
<p>The Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures (MELC) B.A. program offers two specializations: 1) Languages and Literature and 2) Middle Eastern Worlds. Students in the Languages and Literature specialization can pursue a major in the modern languages of: </p>
<ul>
	<li><span>Arabic </span></li>
	<li><span>Hebrew </span></li>
	<li><span>Persian </span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Middle Eastern Worlds specialization is the study of the material, intellectual, religious histories, and cultures of the region from ancient to modern times. Students can pursue a major in:</p>
<ul>
	<li><span>Middle Eastern Ancient Worlds</span></li>
	<li><span>Middle Eastern Modern Worlds</span></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the major program, the department offers a minor in Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures (MELC), as well as minors in Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, and Turkish. <span>For more information about the major and minor programs, please visit the pages below:</span></p>

<h3><strong>Graduate Programs</strong></h3>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/2022-23/graduate/degree-programs/middle-eastern-languages-cultures">Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures</a>: Master's and Ph.D. (with concentrations in Arabic, Hebrew, Persian Languages and Literatures, Near Eastern Archaeology, Art History, Cuneiform, Hebrew Bible, Biblical and Judaic Studies, Old Iranian Studies, Egyptology, and Islamic Studies)</p>
<h3>Libraries</h3>
<p>The Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures libraries are essential parts of the department. These non-circulating libraries are important for research for both graduate and undergraduate students in the department. The libraries house reference materials relating to the various disciplines within MELC, as well as more general monographs and serials, and serve as seminar classrooms. </p>
<p>The <strong>Hebrew/Semitics Library</strong> and the <strong>Islamic Studies Library</strong> both contain basic reference materials, including dictionaries and encyclopedias, and some of the most important texts in their fields. Access is generally limited to graduate students in the department. Both libraries are non-circulating. </p>
<p>The <strong>Baer-Keller Library of Egyptology</strong> is a non-circulating collection of approximately 9,000 volumes maintained by the Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures Department primarily for the use of UC Berkeley students and faculty pursuing a serious study of ancient Egyptian culture, Coptology, and Papyrology. Egyptology students and professionals from other institutions are also welcome. Interested individuals should apply to the Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures Department. The core of the library collection comes from bequests to the Department of Near Eastern Studies by Professors Klaus Baer (1987) and Cathleen (Candy) Keller (2008). Professor Baer was an Associate Professor of Egyptology and History at UC Berkeley before becoming a Professor of Egyptology at the Oriental Institute, University of Chicago. Professor Keller was an Associate Professor of Egyptology at UC Berkeley for many years.</p>
<p>Cooperative arrangements between the University and the nearby Graduate Theological Union enable students in the department to use the extensive library holdings of the Union and supplement their programs with selected courses in Palestinian archaeology, Biblical studies, and Semitic epigraphy and philology.</p>

The course aims to help students expand their knowledge and understanding of the social, economic, and cultural complexities that underlie current</span><span class="deschide"> events and politics in the Middle East.

Disease is a constant of the human condition. Like health, it is both a social construct and a physical reality. Epidemics are diseases that affect very large numbers of people; pandemics are epidemics with a passport—they spread over multiple countries and often continents. In this course we will survey, compare, and contrast ancient and modern conceptions of disease and health, and medicine and doctors, and examine and evaluate what evidence exists—historical</span><span class="deschide">, textual, archaeological--for identifying epidemics and pandemics in ancient times.</span><br/>

The most famous of Babylonian heroes is Gilgamesh, King of Uruk. The Gilgamesh Epic, recorded on twelve tablets in cuneiform, follows him in his quest for fame and eternal life. In this course, we will read the Gilgamesh Epic as well as several earlier texts around the same character. Moreover, we will read additional ancient texts that elucidate one or another aspect of the Epic. We will follow the traditions around Gilgamesh and see how his fame</span><span class="deschide"> was used for literary, religious, and political purposes.

Goal of this class is to increase students' skills in critically evaluating the scholarly value of information on the Ancient Near East that is to be found in web pages, e-journals, and online books.

Although</span><span class="deschide"> the class will focus on Internet resources, we will not neglect to use the same critical eye when using print media.

A major concern is the relationship between law and culture, namely, the ways in which the law reflected ideals and tensions ranging from ideological competition between states to the problems of ordinary townspeople and peasants.

This introductory course will cover both the study of the classical Syriac language and a more general introduction to Syriac literature in all its diversity, with particular emphasis on East Syriac. Syriac is both an ancient tongue that can help us access older Christian histories as well as a living language within the liturgy of current Christian communities, such as the Assyrians. For some communities, Syriac is close to the living vernacular</span><span class="deschide"> language. Undergraduate students will read Christian narratives developed in the Middle East from as far back as 1600 years ago.</span><br/>

<h2>Overview</h2>




<p>The Department of Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures (MELC) studies the languages, literature, and cultures of the ancient, medieval, and the modern Middle East. The department offers specialized training in archaeology, art history, Assyriology, Egyptology, Iranian studies, Judaic studies, Islamic studies, comparative Semitics, and Turkish, Hebrew, Arabic, and Persian languages and literature. Students can explore the interconnected worlds of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and their neighbors, as well as the modern literature and diverse cultures and societies of the modern Middle East. Students are given the opportunity to participate in a discovery experience that is innovative, collaborative, transdisciplinary, and features digital research.</p>




<a name="undergraduateprograms"></a>
<h3>Undergraduate Programs</h3>




<p>The Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures (MELC) B.A. program offers two specializations: 1) Languages and Literature and 2) Middle Eastern Worlds. Students in the Languages and Literature specialization can pursue a major in the modern languages of: </p>




<ul>
	<li><span>Arabic </span></li>
	<li><span>Hebrew </span></li>
	<li><span>Persian </span></li>
</ul>




<p>The Middle Eastern Worlds specialization is the study of the material, intellectual, religious histories, and cultures of the region from ancient to modern times. Students can pursue a major in:</p>




<ul>
	<li><span>Middle Eastern Ancient Worlds</span></li>
	<li><span>Middle Eastern Modern Worlds</span></li>
</ul>




<p>In addition to the major program, the department offers a minor in Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures (MELC), as well as minors in Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, and Turkish. <span>For more information about the major and minor programs, please visit the pages below:</span></p>

<h3><strong>Graduate Programs</strong></h3>




<p><a href="/2022-23/graduate/degree-programs/middle-eastern-languages-cultures">Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures</a>: Master's and Ph.D. (with concentrations in Arabic, Hebrew, Persian Languages and Literatures, Near Eastern Archaeology, Art History, Cuneiform, Hebrew Bible, Biblical and Judaic Studies, Old Iranian Studies, Egyptology, and Islamic Studies)</p>




<a name="libraries"></a>
<h3>Libraries</h3>




<p>The Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures libraries are essential parts of the department. These non-circulating libraries are important for research for both graduate and undergraduate students in the department. The libraries house reference materials relating to the various disciplines within MELC, as well as more general monographs and serials, and serve as seminar classrooms. </p>




<p>The <strong>Hebrew/Semitics Library</strong> and the <strong>Islamic Studies Library</strong> both contain basic reference materials, including dictionaries and encyclopedias, and some of the most important texts in their fields. Access is generally limited to graduate students in the department. Both libraries are non-circulating. </p>




<p>The <strong>Baer-Keller Library of Egyptology</strong> is a non-circulating collection of approximately 9,000 volumes maintained by the Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures Department primarily for the use of UC Berkeley students and faculty pursuing a serious study of ancient Egyptian culture, Coptology, and Papyrology. Egyptology students and professionals from other institutions are also welcome. Interested individuals should apply to the Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures Department. The core of the library collection comes from bequests to the Department of Near Eastern Studies by Professors Klaus Baer (1987) and Cathleen (Candy) Keller (2008). Professor Baer was an Associate Professor of Egyptology and History at UC Berkeley before becoming a Professor of Egyptology at the Oriental Institute, University of Chicago. Professor Keller was an Associate Professor of Egyptology at UC Berkeley for many years.</p>




<p>Cooperative arrangements between the University and the nearby Graduate Theological Union enable students in the department to use the extensive library holdings of the Union and supplement their programs with selected courses in Palestinian archaeology, Biblical studies, and Semitic epigraphy and philology.</p>

This course provides a multidisciplinary introduction to the Middle East, an area that has long dominated the news but remains relatively unknown to most Americans. In a broad sense, the Middle East refers to “Arab” countries in general as well as Israel, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, and the region of Kurdistan. The course aims to help students expand their knowledge and understanding of the social, economic, and cultural complexities that underlie current</span><span class="deschide"> events and politics in the Middle East. We will examine the interplay of cultures, societies, and economies of various regional communities that remain central to the dynamics of Middle Eastern identities.</span><br/>

Women have been ignored or marginalized in much of past scholarship on ancient Egypt despite their highly visible presence in and importance to ancient Egyptian society. This course examines the roles of women and gender in ancient Egyptian society and belief systems. It reviews sources of evidence and interpretive frameworks for understanding the public and private roles of women and the definition of gender in ancient Egypt. It also places the women of</span><span class="deschide"> ancient Egypt and ancient Egyptian gender constructions into comparative contexts with other ancient eastern Mediterranean and Middle Eastern societies.</span><br/>

Ancient Egypt has fascinated visitors since antiquity to our modern imagination. From mummies, pyramids, and enchanting mythologies, these fanciful ideas have made their ways into books, movies, cartoons, and music. This course will explore the way ancient Egypt has been “consumed” in the West from the Napoleonic campaign to modern pop culture. We will study the impact that ancient Egypt and its wonderful monuments and civilization has had on art, literature, music</span><span class="deschide">, and even a number of religious and spiritual movements in the West as well as in Middle Eastern and African cultures.</span><br/>

Disease is a constant of the human condition. Like health, it is both a social construct and a physical reality. Epidemics are diseases that affect very large numbers of people; pandemics are epidemics with a passport—they spread over multiple countries and often continents. In this course we will survey, compare, and contrast ancient and modern conceptions of disease and health, and medicine and doctors, and examine and evaluate what evidence exists—historical</span><span class="deschide">, textual, archaeological--for identifying epidemics and pandemics in ancient times.</span><br/>

The dynamics of identity in contemporary Israeli and Palestinian fiction. Since in both literary traditions the quest for identity invariably involves an encounter with the cultural &quot;other,&quot; the examination of this phenomenon within a single context can be revealing. We will approach the subject through lectures, discussion, and the viewing of video and film dramatizations of Arabic and Hebrew works that deal with identity, and make use of the class location</span><span class="deschide"> to significantly enhance learning by visiting Arabic and Hebrew theaters and literary establishments and by meeting and interacting with Israeli and Palestinian writers, critics, and scholars.</span><br/>

This course investigates the writing, transmission, and reception of The Thousand and One Nights. After studying the tales and examining their structure, students will investigate how stories were transmitted, translated, and received in Europe. This process offers a window into 19th-century attitudes about gender and race, especially Western views of the &quot;oriental&quot; other. How the tales were creatively manipulated by Western writers will be studied as will</span><span class="deschide"> the influence of these stories on modern Arabic literature. Examples of how the stories are represented in Western films will be considered. All works will be read in English translation.</span><br/>

This course examines the social and religious lives of women and men through the lens of the law. A major concern is the relationship between law and culture, namely, the ways in which the law reflected ideals and tensions ranging from ideological competition between states to the problems of ordinary townspeople and peasants. In analyzing actual court cases, we will ask how individuals participated in the life of the court, and how they used the court to articulate</span><span class="deschide"> their own self-interest and sense of moral worth. Readings will be in English. Students wishing to work with sources in the original Ottoman Turkish should also enroll in Turkish 104 (1 unit).</span><br/>

This introductory course will cover both the study of the classical Syriac language and a more general introduction to Syriac literature in all its diversity, with particular emphasis on East Syriac. Syriac is both an ancient tongue that can help us access older Christian histories as well as a living language within the liturgy of current Christian communities, such as the Assyrians. For some communities, Syriac is close to the living vernacular</span><span class="deschide"> language.

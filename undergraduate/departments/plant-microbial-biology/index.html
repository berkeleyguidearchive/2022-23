<h2>Overview</h2>




<p>The Department of Plant and Microbial Biology consists of the Division of Plant Biology and the Division of Microbial Biology. Programs at both the undergraduate and graduate levels have been designed to offer students maximum flexibility in defining their own areas of interest. In addition to departmental resources that are available in Koshland Hall, the facilities of the College of Natural Resources Biological Imaging Facility and the United States Department of Agriculture Plant Gene Expression Center are available for the programs of the department.</p>




<a name="thedivisionofplantbiology"></a>
<h3>The Division of Plant Biology</h3>




<p>The Division of Plant Biology program emphasizes basic research and its application to plants and promotes the design of plant biotechnologies. With an increasing awareness of environmental problems, global changes, and emerging food needs, plants are a focal point for new research initiatives and educational training programs. Understanding the biology of plants, their development, their responses to the environment, and the impact of human activities on the plant biosphere are many of the challenges that will continue to fuel the expansion of plant biology research well into the twenty-first century.</p>




<a name="thedivisionofmicrobialbiology"></a>
<h3>The Division of Microbial Biology</h3>




<p>The Division of Microbial Biology was established within the department to provide a focus for microbial biology at UC Berkeley. There is a growing awareness that microbes and microbial activities are essential to maintaining a high quality of life for all eukaryotes. Moreover, understanding the microbial world is necessary if we are to comprehend the global ecosystem, evolutionary history, and diversity of life on earth. The twenty-first century will bring a new understanding of the workings of the global ecosystem and a wealth of new technologies derived from the microbial world. The new microbial biology research programs are designed to meet this challenge.</p>

How can genetics help increase the food supply even as farmland conditions degrade? How genetically unique are humans? What do buzzwords like GWAS and epigenetics refer to, and how are they impacting medicine and public health? This introductory course for non-science majors will explore topics like these as students learn the foundations of scientific reasoning, genetics concepts and approaches, and their promise and limits in addressing societal</span><span class="deschide"> challenges past and present. Objectives include learning fundamentals of biology and their applications; building students’ capacity to make informed interpretations of experimental data and policies involving “genetics” in a changing world; and to understand our place in nature.</span><br/>

This course offers a consideration of genes, enzymes, metabolic pathways and biochemical processes leading to the generation of hydrogen, bio-oils, ethanol, and other biofuels. Discussion of biochemistry is extended to cover product yields and techno-economic analyses of commercial viability of the various biofuel products. Lectures are based on historical and contemporary papers in plant and microbial biochemistry, integrating structure</span><span class="deschide">, function and evolution of the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels, and discussing how this knowledge can be applied in the generation of renewable biofuels.</span><br/>

After an introduction to the different aspects of our global energy consumption, the course will focus on the role of biomass. The course will illustrate how the global scale of energy guides the biomass research. Emphasis will be places on the integration of the biological aspects (crop selection, harvesting, storage, and distribution, and chemical composition of biomass) with the chemical aspects to convert biomass to energy. The course aims</span><span class="deschide"> to engage students in state-of-art research.</span><br/>

<h2>Overview</h2>




<p>The Department of African American Studies is an intellectual community committed to producing, refining and advancing knowledge of Black people in the United States, the Caribbean, Latin America, Europe, and Africa. A key component of our mission is to interrogate the meanings and dimensions of slavery and colonialism, and their continuing political, social and cultural implications.</p>




<p>Our faculty is drawn from disciplines as diverse as anthropology, cultural studies, linguistics, literature, history, sociology, performance, and creative writing. We are united by a relentless commitment to pushing the boundaries of knowledge through excellence in scholarship and pedagogy that are at once interdisciplinary and innovative.</p>




<p>We fully embrace the notion that a public institution can lead in shaping and defining disciplines, not just teaching them. We contribute to this mission by investing in a strong faculty and talented and ambitious graduate students from a variety of backgrounds. Our faculty is drawn from disciplines as diverse as anthropology, cultural studies, linguistics, literature, history, sociology, performance, and education. But we are not simply a collection of experts from traditional disciplines; we are united by a relentless commitment to pushing the boundaries of knowledge through excellence in scholarship and pedagogy that are at once interdisciplinary and innovative.</p>

The purpose of this course is to examine the many forms that the struggle of minorities can assume. The focus is on individual struggle and its outcome as reported and perceived by the individuals themselves. Members of three minority aggregates are considered: African Americans, Asian Americans (so called), and Chicano/Latino Americans. The choice of these three has to do with the different histories of members of these</span><span class="deschide"> aggregrates. Such differences have produced somewhat different approaches to struggle.</span><br/>

The course will provide an overview of the linguistic structure of African languages. Because the Bantu languages constitute the largest sub-group in sub-Saharan Africa, there will be much focus on the description of the major grammatical features of Bantu languages. The descriptions of African linguistic structure will be accompanied by insights into the contributions made by African languages to general linguistics. Data from various African</span><span class="deschide"> languages will be brought in to illustrate relevant aspects of African linguistic structure.</span><br/>

This course uses film to investigate the central role of race in American culture. Through the study of film history, from silent film of the Jim Crow era to the digitized dystopias of the 21st century, this course explores the relationship between art and politics, race and representation. Looking at both Hollywood and independent cinema, the course charts the continuities and varieties of representations of race in cinema, considering the</span><span class="deschide"> overlapping histories of African Americans, whiteness and ethnicity, American Indians, Mexican Americans, the “Third World” and Multiculturalism in film. Films screened include The Birth of a Nation (1915) The Jazz Singer (1927) Salt of the Earth (1953) The Searchers (1956) Imitation of Life (1958).</span><br/>

<h2><span>Overview</span></h2>
<p>The Global Poverty and Practice (GPP) program is an undergraduate minor, administered by The Blum Center for Developing Economies.</p>
<p>The GPP Minor introduces students to the theoretical frameworks, methods, and practical skills necessary to engage with global poverty and inequality in effective ways. Central to the minor is a &quot;Practice Experience&quot; in which students partner with domestic or international non-governmental or community organizations, government agencies, or other poverty or development programs, on various dimensions of poverty action.  The combination of the the coursework for the Minor and this real world experience allows students to connect theories and practices of poverty action.</p>
<p><strong>Students graduating with a minor in Global Poverty and Practice will be able to demonstrate a basic understanding of the following:</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>Scholarly approaches to understanding poverty, wealth, and inequality in a historical and global context</li>
	<li>Knowledge of international development and domestic poverty alleviation policies, programs, institutions, and social movements</li>
	<li>Critical engagement in public debates about poverty and poverty action through written texts, as well as through the use of social, digital, and visual media</li>
	<li> Knowledge of the history and contemporary politics of poverty and inequality in a particular place or world region, in preparation for the practice requirement of the minor</li>
	<li>Analytical and practical skills gained through a practice experience in a particular sector of poverty action (e.g., agricultural and rural development, urban poverty, public health, human rights, legal systems, education, energy resources, and sustainable technology), at various scales (e.g., community, global) and in various forms (e.g., government policy, social movements)</li>
	<li>An understanding of different modalities and relations of power involved in poverty action developed through historically informed analytical skills, practice experience, and critical reflection</li>
</ol>

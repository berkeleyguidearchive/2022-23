<title>Military Affairs</title>


<text>
<![CDATA[  
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Military Affairs Program, within the Division of Undergraduate and Interdisciplinary Studies (UGIS), comprises the three distinct military officer commissioning programs: Air Force Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC), Army ROTC, and Naval ROTC. The purpose of the program is to integrate the educational offerings of the separate military services into the regular University curricula. In performing academic functions, the Military Affairs Program operates the same as any other program within UGIS. Its military faculty members, though nominated by the three military services, are subject to the same selection process as other UC Berkeley faculty members, and the Academic Senate's Committee on Courses must approve its curriculum. Military Affairs courses are open to all Berkeley students, as well as to students from other East Bay colleges under cross-enrollment agreements or through UC Berkeley Extension.</p>
<p>No undergraduate majors or minors or graduate degrees are offered in any of the following programs; they are designed to supplement a student's degree program.</p>
<h3>Aerospace Studies (Air Force ROTC)</h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-81a3c73e-7fff-99e6-ab12-4c2964e1b902">The Department of Aerospace Studies (AS) provides instruction in military history and heritage, leadership principles, and national security. While the Aerospace Studies curriculum is designed to develop aspiring leaders in the US Air and Space Force, AS courses are open to all students and do not require enrollment in AFROTC. </span><span>The mission of AFROTC is to “develop leaders of character for tomorrow’s Air and Space Force.” As such, AS courses emphasize student participation and involvement. Courses are conducted as seminars and require active student discussion. AS courses are presented in increasing topic depth and complexity as follows (note, AS courses do not pre-requisite requirements): </span></p>

</ul>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-81a3c73e-7fff-99e6-ab12-4c2964e1b902">In addition to Berkeley students, AS courses are available to students from 38 Bay Area colleges and universities through our crosstown enrollment program (see <a href="https://airforcerotc.berkeley.edu/">airforcerotc.berkeley.edu</a> for a list of participating crosstown schools). </span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-81a3c73e-7fff-99e6-ab12-4c2964e1b902">The Department of Aerospace Studies provides interested students the opportunity to become a General Military Candidate in the Air Force Reserve Officers' Training Corps (AFROTC). Enrollment in AFROTC transitions an AS student into an AFROTC cadet, which permits a cadet to compete for a commission as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Air Force or the United States Space Force. </span><span>To become an active cadet at Detachment 085, each eligible UCB or crosstown student must have at least three full academic years remaining in their bachelor's degree program; under certain circumstances, a student may join the AFROTC program while simultaneously completing a graduate degree program.  </span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-81a3c73e-7fff-99e6-ab12-4c2964e1b902">Developing a leader's character requires more than academics. In addition to the AS courses, active cadets are required to attend:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-81a3c73e-7fff-99e6-ab12-4c2964e1b902">A weekly 2-hour leadership laboratory (LLAB) that is restricted to, and mandatory for all AFROTC cadets; LLAB consists of cadets organizing, leading and managing their own cadet military unit while accomplishing leadership training objectives.</span></p>

	<li>
	<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-81a3c73e-7fff-99e6-ab12-4c2964e1b902">At least two 1-hour, cadet-led physical fitness sessions.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-81a3c73e-7fff-99e6-ab12-4c2964e1b902">Complete a military physical fitness assessment each term.</span></p>

</ul>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-81a3c73e-7fff-99e6-ab12-4c2964e1b902">Active cadets further their leadership development through participation in volunteer projects, professional leadership organizations, professional development training, military internships, shadow programs, and support of community outreach. </span><span>AFROTC cadets are eligible to compete for scholarships, which cover the costs of tuition, books, and fees.  In addition, a $300-$350 monthly allowance is paid to scholarship cadets; a $450-$500 monthly allowance paid to all cadets in their last two years in the AFROTC program.</span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-81a3c73e-7fff-99e6-ab12-4c2964e1b902">For more information on becoming a leader in AFROTC and a future officer in the US Air or Space Force, see our website at see <a href="https://airforcerotc.berkeley.edu/">airforcerotc.berkeley.edu</a>. </span></p>
<h3>Military Science (Army ROTC)</h3>
<p>The Army Officer Education Program offers a variety of credit courses focused on the study of the military as an institution, adventure training opportunities, and a program of laboratory work in practical military skills. The program provides an opportunity to examine service in the Army while earning a baccalaureate degree. A student who completes the program may earn a commission in the Regular Army, Army Reserve, or National Guard.</p>
<p>Graduate or undergraduate students can complete the Military Science requirements through a four-year, three-year, or two-year program. The four-year and three-year programs involve the Basic and Advanced Courses; the two-year program involves only the Advanced Course. The Army Reserve Officers' Training Course (ROTC) Basic Course consists of two distinct components: the classroom introduction to the Army profession and officership of the Military Science and Leadership (MSL) I year, and the experiential examination of leadership, decision-making, and group process of the MSL-II year.  Both Basic Course years are designed to enhance student interest in ROTC and the Army.  </p>
<p>MSL-I lessons provide an overview of the key subjects of pre-commissioning, which will be treated in much greater depth in the Advanced Course. The MSL-II year places cadets in a wide variety of group exercises designed to emphasize various professional leadership competencies and insights. These events are held both inside the classroom and in outdoor settings. The instructor, acting as facilitator, helps guide student processing, or after-action reviews, of the events to derive the leadership, group dynamics, and problem-solving lessons that the exercises offer. In addition to military skills, practical &quot;life skills&quot; are emphasized throughout the two years.</p>
<p>Cadets may also be required to attend Basic Camp, a four-week summer ROTC training experience at Fort Knox, Kentucky. By the end of the Basic Course, cadets should possess a basic understanding of the unique aspects of the officer corps, individual fitness, and healthy lifestyle. The lessons are designed to maximize cadet participation, inspire intellectual curiosity, and stimulate self-study. Upon completion of the course, cadets are eligible to enter the Advanced Course.</p>
<p>The Army ROTC Advanced Course is composed of four courses, <span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="MIL SCI 131">MIL SCI 131</span></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="MIL SCI 132">MIL SCI 132</span></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="MIL SCI 141">MIL SCI 141</span></span>, and <span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="MIL SCI 142">MIL SCI 142</span></span>, and Advanced Camp, which is a mandatory four-week leader development training course conducted during the summer at Fort Knox, Kentucky. </p>
<p>The Advanced Course is designed to teach all knowledge, skills, and attitudes for commissioning as a new second lieutenant, and to establish a sound foundation for a career as a commissioned Army officer. This approach is taken because the Advanced Course comprises the minimum curriculum that an individual must complete in order to be commissioned. Advanced Course lessons are carefully sequenced and linked and are progressive in their treatment of key officer knowledge and competencies. Students are encouraged to synthesize lessons to form broader perspectives, deeper insights, and more robust problem-solving abilities by the use of earlier lessons. Topics are designed to facilitate entry into military service at the completion of the <span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="MIL SCI 142">MIL SCI 142</span></span> term.</p>
<p>The two-year program begins with direct placement in the Advanced Course. It is available to undergraduate or graduate students, who have completed any of the following: enlisted military service, completion of ROTC Basic Camp, or three years of Junior ROTC. Students must have at least two academic years left until completion of their degree when they enter the Advanced Course.</p>
<h3>Naval Science (Naval ROTC)</h3>
<p>The Department of Naval Science offers a program of instruction for men and women leading to commissions in either the US Navy or US Marine Corps.  Naval Science courses are open to all university students or, subject to approval, may be taken through UC Berkeley Extension.</p>
<p>Students enrolled in the Naval ROTC program will normally complete the following courses during their first two years as part of their overall academic load:  <span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="NAV SCI 1">NAV SCI 1</span></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="NAV SCI 2">NAV SCI 2</span></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="NAV SCI 3">NAV SCI 3</span></span>, and <span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="NAV SCI 10">NAV SCI 10</span></span>.  Navy Option students will then complete the following courses during their junior and senior years:  <span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="NAV SCI 12A">NAV SCI 12A</span></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="NAV SCI 12B">NAV SCI 12B</span></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="NAV SCI 401">NAV SCI 401</span></span>, and <span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="NAV SCI 412">NAV SCI 412</span></span>.  Marine Option students will participate in a Marine seminar and complete the Fundamentals of Maneuver Warfare (<span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="NAV SCI 154">NAV SCI 154</span></span>) and Evolution of Warfare (<span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="NAV SCI 20">NAV SCI 20</span></span>).  All Navy Option scholarship students must complete one year of calculus and one year of calculus-based physics by the end of their sophomore and junior years respectively.</p>
<p>Students are also required to attend weekly professional development laboratories each Thursday. These three-hour sessions offer the student midshipman an active role in the management and direction of the midshipman battalion and provide time for the midshipmen to explore professional topics. Student midshipmen also participate in four-to-six week summer training cruises throughout the world.  While at sea and serving alongside Sailors and Officers, they apply theoretical aspects of their education and training to the real-world environment of the U.S. Navy. Marine Option midshipmen attend Marine Corps Officer Candidates School in the summer between their junior and senior year.</p>

What is leadership? Does leadership remain fundamentally the same when you change scale or purpose, or does it in some way become fundamentally different? What is good leadership? Are the virtues of leadership universal and unchanging, or are they relative to your historical circumstances? Who can be a leader? Can leadership be taught, or is it something you are born with? How do we gain knowledge about leadership? Can we learn leadership through</span><span class="deschide"> logic, reasoning from fundamental ideas, or do we require experimentation and empirical evidence? These are some of the questions we will be investigating through the close reading of classic texts on the philosophy of leadership, such as Plato’s Statesman and Machiavelli’s The Prince.</span><br/>

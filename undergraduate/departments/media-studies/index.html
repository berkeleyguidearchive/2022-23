<h2>Overview</h2>




<p><span class="s1">The Media Studies major at the University of California, Berkeley is an undergraduate interdisciplinary group major in the <a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/ls-divisions/undergraduate-studies/undergraduate-degrees-programs">Office of Undergraduate and Interdisciplinary Studies (UGIS)</a>. We offer students the analytical tools available to examine media—old and new, local to global—sites of meaning-making production and consumption of identities, cultures, and politics. Courses taught by core faculty in Media Studies cover media histories and theories emphasizing media networks, institutions,  policies, and practices. Additionally, faculty from many departments across campus bring the perspectives and methods of their fields to bear on media analysis in a variety of elective courses. Students specialize in concentration: Digital Studies, Global Cultural Studies, or Media Law and Policy.</span></p>

In this course, students learn why sound journalism is so important to a healthy, working democracy. Journalism is rapidly changing. The class will give a context to those changes and provide an overview of comtemporary journalistic institutions. Students will examine how news is made, who decides what news is, who makes it, who profits by it, and what rules guide how reporters and editors work. Central issues affecting journalism, such as bias and professionalism</span><span class="deschide">, will be discussed. The class is not specifically intended for future journalists, but students will learn why pursuing a career in journalism can be so fulfilling and thrilling, as well as becoming better consumers of the news.</span><br/>

The history of journalism is a broad subject--far broader than can comprehensively be covered in a single course. So necessarily, this course takes an idiosyncratic approach. This course examines how news has been defined, discovered, and communicated from its early modern origins to the present. It will also focus on particular areas of journalism. The class will take a critical look at how wars get reported on, including the current war in</span><span class="deschide"> Iraq. The class will examine the role of journalists in the rise of the Cold War more than half a century ago. It will also examine the importance of media barons, by studying two highly readable biographies, one of William Randolph Hearst, the other of Katherine Graham. And finally, the class will look at the role journalists played in unseating President Nixon.</span><br/>

This course introduces students to approaches in the study of digital media, giving<br/>
practical grounding in digital methodologies and tools for social, cultural and media<br/>
analysis. Students learn how to develop a conceptual framework; integrate the<br/>
framework and the method; and identify digitally-centred topics, objects, or subjects for<br/>
study. Through group collaboration and shared knowledge activities, students consider<br/>
how knowledge</span><span class="deschide"> is created within research practice, and in relation to the<br/>
interdisciplinary study of technology, social media, and digital worlds. Students will use<br/>
methods in context; engage in weekly activities like methods games, active peer review,<br/>
and media analysis; and select specific methods they want to learn about.</span><br/>

How have the realities and representations of digital media affected how we think, feel, and interact? What impulses, events, and personalities gave rise to the relentless digitization of information, choice, and even life itself? In this interdisciplinary course, we will attempt to answers these questions together by reading, discussing, and writing about histories and theories of cybernetics and cybercultures. We will consider competing cybernetic models</span><span class="deschide"> of the mind, human behavior, ecological environments, and complex immersive virtual worlds. We will also survey the vast range of visionary, skeptical, and delightfully eccentric responses to the promises and perils of a cybernetic future.</span><br/>

This course takes a Postcolonial Feminist Cultural Studies approach to examine the changing meanings of gender, race and national identity in popular cultures across the globe.

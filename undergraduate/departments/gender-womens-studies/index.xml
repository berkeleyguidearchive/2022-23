<title>Gender and Women's Studies</title>


<text>
<![CDATA[  
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Department of Gender and Women's Studies offers interdisciplinary perspectives on the formation of gender and its intersections with other relations of power, such as sexuality, race, class, nationality, religion, and age. Questions are addressed within the context of a transnational world and from perspectives as diverse as history, sociology, literary and cultural studies, postcolonial theory, science, new technology, and art.</p>
<p>The department offers an undergraduate major and minor. It also houses an undergraduate minor in Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) Studies, a program whose courses overlap productively with feminist and gender studies. Faculty in the department collaborate with an extensive group of affiliated faculty in Women, Gender and Sexuality, which provides graduate students across campus with a site for transdisciplinary learning and teaching. The department is now in the process of developing a PhD program. The department fosters connections with scholars in feminist and sexuality studies throughout the campus by cross-listing courses, collaborating in research, and participating in the Gender Consortium, which links research and teaching units that focus on gender.</p>
<h3>Community-Engaged Scholarship</h3>
<p>The Gender and Women's Studies Department promotes engaged scholarship through our unique internship courses. Students commit to working with a community-based organization for a minimum of three hours a week for the semester. The hope and challenge of these courses is to go beyond standard educational models in which learning is bound by the classroom and confined to the University. This effort to bridge the gap between the University — as a place of study — and community organizations — as agents of action, grows from the urgent need for opportunities to engage in a coordinated exploration where theory and action inform each other.</p>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p>The<a href="http://bbrg.berkeley.edu/"> Beatrice Bain Research Group</a> (BBRG) is Berkeley’s critical feminist research center, and is the keystone research program within the Department of Gender and Women’s Studies. Each year BBRG hosts approximately 25 visiting scholars from around the globe whose research is centrally on women and gender. In addition, BBRG organizes public scholarly panels on cutting-edge topics in the field of gender studies. <span>Established in 1986 to support and coordinate feminist scholarship across disciplines, the BBRG fosters research on gender and women, and is particularly interested in enabling research on gender in its intersections with sexuality, race, class, nation, religion, postcoloniality, and transnational feminisms.</span></p>
<p class="maintext">The <a href="http://womensstudies.berkeley.edu/news/gender-consortium">Gender Consortium</a> is intended to bring together several campus units dedicated to issues surrounding gender and sexuality. The goal of the Gender Consortium is to provide an infrastructure for coordinating public events, fundraising, applying for external grants, and enhancing undergraduate and graduate education.</p>

The 21st century has seen powerful critiques of both growing economic inequality and the troubling persistence of domination based on gender, race and other categorical differences. Gender has a distinctive role here for many reasons: the centrality of gender to social reproduction; the historical coproduction of male domination and capitalism; and the way gender operates in the constitution of selves. Insofar as capitalism is organized and</span><span class="deschide"> distributes power and profits through gendered structures, and gendered meanings and identities are shaped by their emergence within capitalist logics, it behooves us to think gender and capitalism in tandem.

Gender, sex, and power shape and influence our cultural and social world in obvious and in hidden ways. Bay Area artists and activists focus on illuminating, shifting, redefining, and making use of the juncture of gender, sex, and power to bring about new opportunities and new futures. We will first explore the terrain of academic definitions of gender, sex, power and the connections among them, emphasizing how gender/sex/power</span><span class="deschide"> is interlinked with racism, classism, colonialism, and dis/ablism. Topics addressed will include: labor, migration and belonging; food, shelter, and land; health and health care; sexuality and love; and politics and political action.</span><br/>

<h2>Overview</h2>




<p>UC Berkeley has long been a national leader in Jewish Studies, especially notable for the innovative scholarship promoted in its graduate program. The Center for Jewish Studies provides a strong new focus and a vivid presence for the many varied activities associated with Jewish Studies on the Berkeley campus. It oversees the Designated Emphasis in Jewish Studies for graduate students and the undergraduate minor in Jewish Studies. Additionally, the center is home to UC Berkeley's two annual endowed lecture series, sponsors conferences and public lectures, offers a congenial setting for graduate student colloquia, and serves as an attractive meeting place for the many visiting scholars in the field who come to UC Berkeley each year.</p>

<h3>Campus Partners</h3>




<p>The <a href="http://www.law.berkeley.edu/JLILES.htm" target="_blank">Berkeley Institute for Jewish Law and Israeli Law, Economy and Society</a> is an interdisciplinary initiative to expand Jewish and Israel Studies offerings at UC Berkeley coordinated by faculty in Political Science, Sociology, Economics, Comparative Literature, History, and Music, and in the Law, Journalism, and Business Schools.</p>




<p>The <a href="https://magnes.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Magnes Collection of Jewish Life and Art</a> was established in 2010 at the Bancroft Library after the transfer of the Judah L. Magnes Museum to UC Berkeley. The Magnes is one of the world's preeminent Jewish collections in a university setting. It offers highly innovative and accessible resources to researchers on campus, enables hands-on learning for students interested in Jewish Studies, offers a venue for important programming, and provides fellowships for students working on Jewish culture.</p>




<p>The <a href="http://jewishstudies.berkeley.edu/affiliates-resources/judaica-collection/" target="_blank">UC Berkeley Judaica collection</a> supports the research of students involved in the graduate Jewish Studies Designated Emphasis, the undergraduate minor, and the instructional activities of faculty and students in a number of interdisciplinary fields. These fields include Near Eastern languages and literature; Talmudic studies, including the Babylonian and Palestinian Talmuds and subsequent texts and commentaries; rabbinic, medieval, and modern Jewish history throughout the world; modern Jewish thought; and comparative literature, including works in Hebrew, Yiddish, English, and other languages.</p>

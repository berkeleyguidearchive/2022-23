<h2>Overview</h2>




<p>The Berkeley English Department offers a wide-ranging PhD program engaging in all historical periods of British and American literature, Anglophone literature, and critical and cultural theory. The program aims to assure that students gain a broad knowledge of literature in English as well as the highly-developed skills in scholarship and criticism necessary to do solid and innovative work in their chosen specialized fields.</p>




<p><em>Please note that the department does not offer a Master’s Degree program or a degree program in Creative Writing</em><strong><em>. </em></strong>Students can, however, petition for an MA in English with an emphasis in Creative Writing upon completion of the PhD course requirements (one of which must be a graduate writing workshop) and submission of a body of creative work.</p>




<p>Students interested in combining a PhD in English with studies in another discipline may pursue designated emphases programs in Film Studies; Medieval Studies; and Women, Gender, and Sexuality.</p>




<p>Normative time to complete the program is six years. The first two years are devoted to fulfilling the course and language requirements. The third year is spent preparing for and taking the PhD oral qualifying examination. The fourth through sixth years are devoted to researching and writing the prospectus and dissertation.</p>

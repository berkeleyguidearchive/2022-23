<h2>Overview</h2>




<p>The Department of History is one of the largest and most respected units in UC Berkeley's College of Letters and Science. The Department's faculty ranges across virtually all of the major geographical and chronological fields recognized by the discipline. Berkeley has long been proud of its extensive engagement with the history of Asia, a part of the world only recently given its due by many other history departments. While developing ambitious programs in the study of East Asian, South Asian, Southeast Asian, and Middle Eastern history, UC Berkeley has also maintained and increased its reputation in the several fields in which it first attained distinction in the first half of the 20th century: Ancient, Medieval, Early Modern, and Modern European, Latin American, and United States history. Many faculty members are also doing pioneering work in transnational, international, and global approaches to historical scholarship. The Department is comprehensive also in the thematic and methodological emphases that render the study of history one of the most capacious of all academic callings. Although in recent years the Department's strengths in cultural, intellectual, and political history have been the most widely noted, the Department's distinction in social, economic, international and other kinds of history is also recognized throughout the world.</p>




<p><br/>
Professional assessments of the nation's history departments (e.g., those sponsored by the National Research Council) usually rank Berkeley first, second, or third. The intellectual stature of the Department's faculty is registered in many metrics, including the fact that seventeen regular or emeriti members have been elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In addition, individual members of the Department have often carried major responsibility within the Campus's administration. The Department also enjoys a reputation for excellence in both undergraduate and graduate teaching. Many of its members have won major teaching awards in recent years. Our students, both undergraduate and graduate students, have been highly successful in winning university and external prizes and fellowships to support their innovative research. The Department's baccalaureate and doctoral alumni have gone on to a variety of successful careers in fields such as research, education, law, business, non-profits and NGOs, journalism, public affairs, diplomacy, and international relations.</p>

This seminar provides a broad overview of the discipline of History. Beyond examining influential works that continue to shape how we write, teach, and think about history, it familiarizes students with important subfields of the discipline, and seminal thinkers who helped shape them. Though the course probes no topic or approach in depth, it does aim to facilitate a working knowledge of a range of methods and theoretical vocabularies with which</span><span class="deschide"> historians should be conversant. Students must take this course in their first semester.</span><br/>

This class explores what is happening to higher education and the historical profession in the contemporary world and how the job market for historians is changing. The aim is to demystify the academy and the historical profession while encouraging deeper thinking about career diversity and development. We will focus on practical questions like how and when you get your reading done, how you prepare for 3rd semester and qualifying exams, visit and use archives, develop</span><span class="deschide"> research skills, prepare grant proposals, build a CV/Resume, attend conferences and present papers, publish reviews and articles. It will also address how you survive this intensification of academic labor, addressing issues such as mental health and resources for parents.</span><br/>

This class introduces graduate students to a variety of theories and techniques used in teaching history at the university. Through discussion, small group activities, and simulations, the course explores core ideas of history pedagogy. It addresses opportunities and challenges in teaching history as well as common classroom situations to develop the foundation for becoming teachers at Berkeley and beyond. The course has two primary goals:</span><span class="deschide"> (1) to prepare graduate students to teach effectively as GSIs in history classes at Berkeley; and (2) to introduce ideas, practices, and debates in teaching and learning to support graduate students' professional development into independent instructors, in and out of the classroom.</span><br/>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) sponsors a Designated Emphasis in Computational and Data Science and Engineering (DE-CDSE) program that is committed to the development of new curricula and expanded programs, which are aimed at development and propagation of the use of numerical and computational tools to further research across multiple disciplines.Â This interdisciplinary Designated Emphasis recognizes the integral role of advanced computational techniques for mathematical modeling and simulation in a range of fields for the analysis of complex physical systems such as computer chip manufacturing, battery modeling, turbine design, aircraft prototype testing, climate change, and star formation, among others.</p>

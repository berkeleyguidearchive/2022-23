The course aims to introduce a variety of mathematical and computational methods useful in solving research problems pertaining to chemical and biomolecular systems. The course covers a wide range of topics from linear algebra and matrices, differential equations, and stochastic methods. Even though the focus is primarily on analytical methods, most of the concepts will be demonstrated with computations and applications. The goal of the course</span><span class="deschide"> is to ensure that the students are aware of a wide range of computational methods that can be useful in their research and to provide the students with sufficient background in applied mathematics that can be useful in reading the science and engineering literature.<br/></span><br/>

Machine learning in the context of scientific problems is an exciting emerging area of research, and often requires the development of new methods that can incorporate and exploit the inductive biases and structure needed for such problems. There are also now numerous examples of concepts in physics historically influencing machine learning methods development more broadly. This course will give an overview of different physics-inspired machine learning methods</span><span class="deschide">, and the connections between concepts in physics (numerical methods, dynamical systems, symmetries, conservation laws) and machine learning.</span><br/>

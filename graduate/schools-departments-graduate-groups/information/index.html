<div class="field-item odd">
<p>The School of Information is a graduate research and education community committed to expanding access to information and to improving its usability, reliability, and credibility while preserving security and privacy. This requires the insights of scholars from diverse fields — information and computer science, design, social sciences, management, law, and policy.</p>
<p>Roughly 120 graduate students and two dozen faculty members are based on the UC Berkeley campus, in UC Berkeley’s historic South Hall, with another 1100 students online. Together they form a multi-disciplinary collective of scholars and practitioners collaborating on initiatives at the intersection of people, information, and technology.</p>
<p>The I School offers three professional master’s degrees and an academic doctoral degree. The <a href="/archive/2022-23/graduate/degree-programs/information-management-systems/" target="_blank">MIMS program</a> trains students for careers as information professionals and emphasizes small classes and project-based learning. The <a href="/archive/2022-23/graduate/degree-programs/information-data-science/" target="_blank">MIDS program</a> trains data scientists to manage and analyze the coming onslaught of big data, in a unique high-touch online degree. The <a href="/archive/2022-23/graduate/degree-programs/information-cybersecurity/" target="_blank">MICS program</a> trains students for careers in cybersecurity by providing them with skills and contextual knowledge necessary to develop solutions for complex cybersecurity challenges. The <a href="/archive/2022-23/graduate/degree-programs/information-management-systems-phd/" target="_blank">PhD program</a> equips scholars to develop solutions and shape policies that influence how people seek, use, and share information.</p>

<h3>History</h3>




<p>The UC Berkeley School of Information was created in 1994 to address one of society’s most compelling challenges: enabling people to create, find, manipulate, share, store, and use information in myriad forms.</p>




<p>Originally known as the School of Information Management and Systems (SIMS), this research-and-learning enterprise became the School of Information in 2006. The I School traces its roots to the 1920s, when UC Berkeley founded its School of Librarianship, ensuring universal access to information and educating &quot;knowledge&quot; professionals well before the age of the Internet. In 1976 the School of Librarianship became the School of Library and Information Studies. </p>




<p>The I School proudly carries forward its library school heritage through its alumni, and through an enduring commitment to making information accessible, useful, and relevant.</p>

Foundations of data science from three perspectives: inferential thinking, computational thinking, and real-world relevance. Given data arising from some real-world phenomenon, how does one analyze that data so as to understand that phenomenon? The course teaches critical concepts and skills in computer programming and statistical inference, in conjunction</span><span class="deschide"> with hands-on analysis of real-world datasets, including economic data, document collections, geographical data, and social networks.

Surveying history through the lens of information and information through the lens of history, this course looks across time to consider what might distinguish ours as &quot;the information age&quot; and what that description implies about the role of &quot;information technology&quot; across time. We will select moments in societies' development of information production, circulation, consumption, and storage from the earliest writing and</span><span class="deschide"> numbering systems to the world of Social Media. In every instance, we'll be concerned with what and when, but also with how and why.

This course introduces students to natural language processing and exposes them to the variety of methods available for reasoning about text in computational systems. NLP is deeply interdisciplinary, drawing on both linguistics and computer science, and helps drive much contemporary work in text analysis (as used in computational social science, the digital humanities, and computational journalism). We will focus on major algorithms used</span><span class="deschide"> in NLP for various applications (part-of-speech tagging, parsing, coreference resolution, machine translation) and on the linguistic phenomena those algorithms attempt to model.

As it's generally used, &quot;information&quot; is a collection of notions, rather than a single coherent concept. In this course, we'll examine conceptions of information based in information theory, philosophy, social science, economics, and history. Issues include: How compatible are these conceptions; can we talk about &quot;information&quot; in the abstract? What work do these various notions play in discussions of literacy, intellectual</span><span class="deschide"> property, advertising, and the political process? And where does this leave &quot;information studies&quot; and &quot;the information society&quot;?</span><br/>

&quot;Behavioral Economics&quot; is one important perspective on how information impacts human behavior. The goal of this class is to deploy a few important theories about the relationship between information and behavior, into practical settings — emphasizing the design of experiments that can now be incorporated into many 'applications' in day-to-day life. Truly 'smart systems' will have built into them precise, testable propositions about</span><span class="deschide"> how human behavior can be modified by what the systems tell us and do for us. So let's design these experiments into our systems from the ground up! This class develops a theoretically informed, practical point of view on how to do that more effectively and with greater impact.<br/></span><br/>

As new sources of digital data proliferate in developing economies, there is the exciting possibility that such data could be used to benefit the world’s poor. Through a careful reading of recent research and through hands-on analysis of large-scale datasets, this course introduces students to the opportunities and challenges for data-intensive approaches to international development. Students should be prepared to dissect, discuss, and replicate academic</span><span class="deschide"> publications from several fields including development economics, machine learning, information science, and computational social science. Students will also conduct original statistical and computational analysis of real-world data.</span><br/>

This course provides students with real-world experience assisting politically vulnerable organizations and persons around the world to develop and implement sound cybersecurity practices. In the classroom, students study basic theories and practices of digital security, intricacies of protecting largely under-resourced organizations, and tools needed to manage risk in complex political, sociological, legal, and ethical contexts. In the clinic</span><span class="deschide">, students work in teams supervised by Clinic staff to provide direct cybersecurity assistance to civil society organizations. We emphasize pragmatic, workable solutions that take into account the unique needs of each partner organization.</span><br/>

This course offers valuable perspective for both the non-technical business manager and the technical cybersecurity or IT manager. It is the vital connector between the technical world of threats, vulnerabilities, and exploits, and the business world of board-level objectives, enterprise risk management, and organizational leadership. Now more than ever, managers have a need and responsibility to understand cyber risk. Just as financial risks</span><span class="deschide"> and other operational risks have to be effectively managed within an organization, cyber risk has to be managed.

This course surveys privacy mechanisms applicable to systems engineering, with a particular focus on the inference threat arising due to advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning. We will briefly discuss the history of privacy and compare two major examples of general legal frameworks for privacy from the United States and the European Union. We then survey three design frameworks of privacy that may be used to guide the design of privacy-aware</span><span class="deschide"> information systems. Finally, we survey threat-specific technical privacy frameworks and discuss their applicability in different settings, including statistical privacy with randomized responses, anonymization techniques, semantic privacy models, and technical privacy mechanisms.</span><br/>

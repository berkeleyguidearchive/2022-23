<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>PhD students at UC Berkeley may add a Designated Emphasis in Women, Gender, and Sexuality (DEWGS) to their major fields. Designed to enhance interdisciplinary graduate studies at Berkeley, the DEWGS provides curricular and research resources and opportunities to students who are already admitted to graduate degree programs on campus.</p>
<p>The designated emphasis program was developed to accommodate some of the many students who conduct graduate-level research in related topics across numerous fields. Administered by the Department of Gender and Women's Studies, the designated emphasis program provides its students with certification, as well as with a context for the interdisciplinary exchange of ideas and development of research.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="column column-number-1 column-span-1">
<p>UC Berkeley’s Department of Art Practice provides professional art training within the context of a world-renowned public research university. The department offers innovative, interdisciplinary courses leading to BA and MFA degrees. As practicing visual artists, the faculty of the Department of Art Practice hold as a principal goal the representation and analysis of human experiences through creative research in visual art. In making art, faculty members seek to expand the boundaries of cultures and the limits of perceptions <span>through rigorous experimentation with art forms, media, and content. Considering human experiences from an experiential standpoint, experimentation leads to questioning beliefs, rituals, and philosophies as well as social, economic, and institutional structures. In teaching, the mission is to help students pose profound questions by developing their creative voices, mastering their practices, relating to their audiences, and connecting to histories of art and cultures.</span></p>
<p>Four goals underlie the teaching in the Department of Art:</p>
<ol>
	<li>To advance the body of knowledge of human experience through aesthetic investigation.</li>
	<li>To help students learn to think visually.</li>
	<li>To help students understand the strategies that artists have devised to deal with aesthetic problems in both traditional and nontraditional methods of art-making.</li>
	<li>To help students develop creative intelligence through practicing a visual arts discipline.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Facilities and Resources</h3>
<p>The Department of Art Practice facilities include six studio spaces: <a href="https://art.berkeley.edu/printmaking" target="_blank">Printmaking Studio</a>, <a href="https://art.berkeley.edu/drawing-painting" target="_blank">Painting and Drawing Studio</a>, <a href="https://art.berkeley.edu/sculpture" target="_blank">Wood and Metal Sculpture Studio</a>, <a href="https://art.berkeley.edu/dml" target="_blank">Digital Media Labs</a> (for photography, video, audio, and animation productions) in the Anthropology and Art Practice Building, the <a href="https://art.berkeley.edu/ceramics" target="_blank">Ceramics Studio</a>, and Project Lab in Wurster Hall.</p>

The ‘designed world’ is implicated in everyday experience. In an increasingly technological and communications based culture-from print to the Web, advertisements to movies, the built environment to modes of pedagogy-we encounter the visual/sensory as a ‘designed world’ in every area of our lives. Art 8 A: Intro to Visual Thinking asks students to rigorously and critically interrogate the ‘designed world.’ To do this students will look at a</span><span class="deschide"> range of art, media, and invention across many locations and periods of history.</span><br/>

Using the format of the graphic novel as a site of investigation, this studio production class will explore graphic novels as dynamic political, societal, historical, and cultural vehicles. Using creative research methods of analysis, fabrication, and collaboration, students will create their own graphic novel elements as artistic responses to their diverse life experiences. Production assignments</span><span class="deschide"> will inform students about possible relations between text and image, frame and page, page and narrative arc, imagination and reality, and finally book and audience. Guest lecturers will share different writing styles, drawing and coloring techniques including digital painting, and storytelling methods.</span><br/>

Water is one of the most precarious resources in California, yet many people believe the water supply to be unlimited. The arts and visual cultures contribute to such popular misconceptions of natural resources, but media art can also help people develop more accurate and relevant conceptions of natural resources. The course introduces students to interdisciplinary creative research and media art production with the end goal of advancing popular conceptions about</span><span class="deschide"> water. Students study water cultures in California from the 1750's onwards and experience a wide range of watercourses and waterworks to inspire new art. Art projects include data visualization, short fiction, billboard designs, and interactive gallery displays.</span><br/>

This course trains students in new strategies in contemporary creative research in the beautiful, ecologically diverse and yet precarious island of Mo’orea in French Polynesia. At Richard B. Gump Station, students will engage in creative research with two faculty members during the course of one month. Students study traditional Polynesian art forms through intensive workshops with</span><span class="deschide"> local artisans at the Atitia Center and create two art projects with local tools and materials in the first two weeks of the course. In the second two weeks, students explore socio-ecological processes in reefs, shores, communities and mountains through visual narratives, including sound recording, video recording, data sonification, editing and dissemination.<br/></span><br/>

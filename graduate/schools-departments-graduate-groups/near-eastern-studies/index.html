<h2>Overview</h2>




<p>Instruction in the Department of Near Eastern Studies (NES) is concerned with the languages, literatures, and civilizations of the ancient, medieval, and modern Near East. The department offers specialized training in archaeology; Assyriology; Egyptology; Judaic and Islamic studies; Comparative Semitics; Turkish language; and Hebrew, Arabic, and Persian language and literature.</p>




<p>The department's courses may also serve to enhance programs in related fields such as anthropology, linguistics, history of art, history, political science, comparative literature, and folklore. Lecture courses offered by the department present a comprehensive body of information on past (Near Eastern) and present (Middle Eastern) civilizations. Many of the courses taught in the department are restricted to a small number of students and thus afford an opportunity for close interaction with the instructing staff.</p>




<p>Cooperative arrangements between the University and the nearby Graduate Theological Union (GTU) enable students in the department to use the extensive library holdings of the GTU and to supplement their programs with additional courses in Syro-Palestinian archaeology, Biblical studies, and Semitic epigraphy and philology.</p>




<a name="libraries"></a>
<h3>Libraries</h3>




<p>The four NES libraries play an essential role in the Department of Near Eastern Studies and are indispensable for student research. The libraries house reference materials and function as reading and seminar rooms for students and faculty.</p>




<p>The Islamic Studies Library contains references and other materials relating to Islamic Studies and Arabic, Persian, and Turkish languages and literatures, and incorporates the Mahjoub Persian Library. The Hebrew/Semitics library includes references and other materials relating to the fields of Comparative Semitics, and Hebrew and Judaic studies. Access <span id="docs-internal-guid-344fa19d-9f9b-a2c1-ceac-e0e5f084bf95">— </span>apart from seminar classes <span id="docs-internal-guid-344fa19d-9f9b-a2c1-ceac-e0e5f084bf95">—</span> is generally limited to graduate students in the department. Both libraries are non circulating. The Cuneiform Seminar Room is a library that provides a wide range of reference works, text editions, and primary sources for the study of the Ancient Near East, including Sumerian, Akkadian, Hittite, Archaeology, and Art History.</p>




<p>The Baer-Keller Library of Egyptology is a non circulating collection of Egyptological volumes maintained by the Near Eastern Studies Department primarily for the use of UC Berkeley students and faculty pursuing serious study of Egyptology. Egyptology students and professionals from other institutions are also welcome; interested individuals should apply to the Near Eastern Studies Department for access. The core of the library collection comes from bequests to NES by Professors Klaus Baer (1987) and Cathleen (Candy) Keller (2008). Professor Baer was an Associate Professor of Egyptology and History at UC Berkeley before becoming a Professor of Egyptology at the Oriental Institute, University of Chicago. Professor Keller was an Associate Professor of Egyptology at UC Berkeley for many years.</p>




<a name="research"></a>
<h3 class="introtext">Research</h3>




<p>The <a href="http://hearstmuseum.berkeley.edu/">Phoebe Hearst Museum of Anthropology</a> has extensive holdings of ancient artifacts, including Classical material, cuneiform tablets, and an ancient Egyptian collection of more than 17,000 objects.</p>




<p>The <a href="http://tebtunis.berkeley.edu/index">Tebtunis Papyri</a> consist of the papyrus documents that were found in the winter of 1899/1900 at the site of ancient Tebtunis, Egypt. The expedition to Tebtunis, led by the British archaeologists Bernard Grenfell and Arthur Hunt, was financed for the University of California by Mrs. Phoebe Apperson Hearst. The Tebtunis Papyri is the largest collection of papyrus documents from a single site in the United States. Although the collection has never been counted and inventoried completely, the number of fragments contained in it exceeds 21,000.</p>




<p>The department's Ancient Near Eastern Seminar Room houses two Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus <a href="http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/">(ORACC)</a> projects: the Digital Corpus of Cuneiform Lexical Texts <a href="http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/dcclt/">(DCCLT) </a>under the directorship of <a href="http://nes.berkeley.edu/Web_Veldhuis/index.html"> Niek Veldhuis</a> and Hellenistic Babylonian Texts Images and Names <a href="http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/hbtin">(HBTIN)</a> directed by Laurie Pearce. Dr. Pearce also heads another digital database project, the Berkeley Prosopography Service<a href="http://berkeleyprosopography.org/"> (BPS)</a>.</p>

This course introduces the hieroglyphic texts of the temples of the Ptolemaic and Roman periods--a time when an increase in the number of signs, and the values that they could hold, widened the scribal playing field for creating expressions that function on multiple aural, visual, and thematic levels.

This introductory course will cover both the study of the classical Syriac language and a more general introduction to Syriac literature in all its diversity, with particular emphasis on East Syriac. Syriac is both an ancient tongue that can help us access older Christian histories as well as a living language within the liturgy of current Christian communities, such as the Assyrians. For some communities, Syriac is close to the living vernacular</span><span class="deschide"> language. Undergraduate students will read Christian narratives developed in the Middle East from as far back as 1600 years ago.</span><br/>

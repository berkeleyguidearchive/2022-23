<![CDATA[  
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Department of Music fosters the cultivation of music on campus through undergraduate and graduate programs of study; and also through public concerts and lectures in Hertz Hall, Morrison Hall, and elsewhere. For undergraduates, the department offers a major in music, as well as numerous nonmajor courses for students with little or no previous experience in music. A minor in music draws on courses for either majors or nonmajors, depending on student qualifications. For graduate students, the department offers programs leading to the MA/PhD or PhD degrees in musical composition, history and literature, or ethnomusicology.</p>
<p>The department's theory courses provide an introduction to the materials of musical composition through ear training, harmony, counterpoint, and analysis. The history and literature courses present a survey of Western music and a detailed study of the chief periods of its development. Courses in ethnomusicology provide the study of specific areas of world music, both in survey and in-depth, and an introduction to the principles and methods of research. Courses in performance (including orchestra, chorus, and various ensembles) offer the opportunity to perform a varied repertory and are open by audition to all students and to auditors.</p>
<h3>Course Placement Procedure</h3>
<p>Students who plan to major in music or wish to take music major classes must complete the Musicianship Placement Exam before beginning music major classes. Students may pre-enroll in classes before the Musicianship Placement Exam and make adjustments to their schedule during the add/drop period if necessary. <span>For detailed information regarding the placement test, see the </span><a href="http://music.berkeley.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate-degree-program/placement-procedure/">Placement Procedure</a><span> page on the department's website.</span></p>
<h3><span>Facilities and Library</span></h3>
<p><span>The <a href="http://cnmat.berkeley.edu/">Center for New Music and Audio Technologies</a> </span>is the site for interdisciplinary research and teaching on the application of computer and related technologies to music and for related concerts, lectures, workshops and seminars by internationally renowned performers, scholars, and researchers.</p>
<p>One of the finest music research collections in the world, the <a href="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MUSI/">Jean Gray Hargrove Music Library</a> provides strong support for instruction, research, and performance at Berkeley. The Hargrove Music Library currently holds some 180,000 volumes of books and printed music; 50,000 sound and video recordings; 30,000 microforms; and extensive manuscript and archival collections. Originally centered on the Western classical tradition, it has in recent years increasingly extended its collecting into non-Western, traditional, and popular music. While supporting advanced research in musicology and ethnomusicology, it also serves the needs of composers and performers. Its extraordinary collection of music manuscripts and early editions, which continues to grow thanks to generous endowments, offers students the opportunity to work directly with original sources.</p>
<p>Now in its 63rd year, the well-attended free noon concert series takes place in <a href="http://music.berkeley.edu/about-us/resources-and-facilities/">Hertz Hall</a>, a 678-seat performance space. Also used for evening concerts, rehearsals, and lecture classes, it is home to many department ensembles including the symphony, choruses, and ensembles.</p>
<p>A campus icon located in the middle of campus, the Campanile houses the 61-bell carillon and features daily performances by carillonists, students, and guests.</p>
<p>Located on the ground floor of Morrison Hall, the <a href="http://music.berkeley.edu/practice-rooms/">music practice rooms</a> at Berkeley consist of 31 small rooms, most with a single piano, as well as five larger grand rooms which double as teaching studios and an organ/early music practice room.</p>
<p>The department maintains several instrument collections, including the Salz Collection of String Instruments, the Baroque Instrument Collection, the Edmond O'Neill Memorial Organs, and World Instruments. In addition, the department houses two special collections of musical resources, the Joan Lam Choral Library and the Chambers Campanology Collection. For further information on these collections, see the <a href="http://music.berkeley.edu/instrument-collections/">department's website</a><span>.</span></p>
<h3>Performance Opportunities</h3>
<p>Unique to UC Berkeley's Department of Music, among the great music departments in the country, is the degree to which performance experience and study are integrated into every aspect of the academic program, whether honing musicianship skills; acquiring knowledge of the music of diverse cultures and traditions; or studying the history and literature of European music or contemporary music life in America and elsewhere. It shows up as a requirement only in one form: Music majors must enroll in at least three semesters of performance from the 140 or 150 series. However, undergraduates and graduate students avail themselves of rich performance opportunities by participating in one of the department’s ensembles that presents evening and weekend concerts; by presenting a noon concert; by auditioning for the opportunity to perform a concerto with the university orchestra; by performing in concerts of the Berkeley Undergraduate Composers Club; and in many other ways.</p>
<p>For further information on these opportunities, see the <a href="http://music.berkeley.edu/performance-opportunities/">department's website</a>.</p>

Radical Listening (MUS 31) considers music through the lenses of extra-musical epistemologies - aesthetics and philosophies related to culture, memory, identity, gender, etc. Listening to music with such considerations can foster and illuminate personal emotional stakes. Cultivating personal stakes in listening has the benefit of moving us towards a greater capacity for empathy - what we do in our most personal aesthetic spaces can project</span><span class="deschide"> outwards into how we engage with others, publicly, as caring citizens. Tactically, we will rehearse applying “radical listening” concepts on some of the most ubiquitous and influential music in Western culture in tandem with important, though esoteric, exponents of experimental music (e.g. Vocaloids).</span><br/>

These tracks will demonstrate progressively advanced production techniques within the style(s) of music that students are interested in.<br/>
Demonstrate an increased awareness and use of musical terminology when discussing their own and other students’ tracks, based on an overview of relevant music theory concepts (writing chord progressions, rhythm and syncopation exercises).<br/>
Select a microphone (from a given list) to use in various recording contexts (which are based on the student setups in the class). If no fellow student setups allow, common recording studio contexts (i.e. 5 piece band, acoustic duo).<br/>
Set up and check from start to finish an Ableton Live session using their personal setup (could include analog/MIDI devices, microphones, acoustic instruments) or if none of the above, a setup with built in microphone and laptop MIDI keyboard. This includes recording and editing MIDI and Audio clips in both Session and Arrangement view while understanding the differences between them.<br/>
Understand and apply basic mixing and mastering techniques and plugins available in Ableton, including but not limited to: compression, EQ, delay, and reverb and the use of return tracks.</p></div>

This course is intended, above all else, to create the circumstances in which we will each independently develop as intimate a relationship as we can with Beethoven’s music. With an open mind and a bit of application, we ought to become well-acquainted with several of his compositions, extremely friendly with others, and perhaps even head over heals in love with a couple of them.<br/>
We’ll be seeking to understand this music through attentive listening and close technical</span><span class="deschide"> description, but also by looking at the historical environments in which it was composed, performed, and heard.<br/>
For that reason, we’re going to take a roughly chronological route through Beethoven’s life and works.</span><br/>

This course introduces ethno/musicological approaches to the study of sexuality and gender. We will study scholarly works that consider how music informs and reflects cultural constructions of femininity, masculinity, and non-binary genders, and consider questions of sexuality within and apart from these frameworks. Taking wide-ranging examples that include popular music, folk and indigenous musics, and European art music, we will investigate</span><span class="deschide"> how gendered and sexualized subjectivities are negotiated through musical practices such as composition, performance, audition, and consumption. Class readings will include ethnomusicological, musicological, anthropological, feminist, Marxist, and queer theory approaches.</span><br/>

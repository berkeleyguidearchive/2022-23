				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p>The UC Berkeley-UCSF Joint Medical Program (JMP) is a five-year graduate/medical degree program. The pre-clerkship years are spent at UC Berkeley, engaging in a leading-edge integrated problem-based-learning medical curriculum while simultaneously earning a master's degree (MS) in the Health and Medical Sciences at UC Berkeley's School of Public Health. After 2.5 three years, our students move across the bay to UCSF to finish their medical education and receive their medical doctorate (MD).</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://sph.berkeley.edu/jmp" target="_blank">Visit Program Website</a></p>

				<a name="mastersdegreerequirementstext"></a><h2>Master's Degree Requirements</h2><p>The UC Berkeley-UCSF Joint Medical Program (JMP) is a pioneer in teaching medicine in the broader context of public health and health systems. <span style="font-size:1em">The goal of the JMP’s curriculum is to train physician “changemakers” who approach medicine with a broad trans-disciplinary understanding of the social and structural determinants of health, health systems science, community health, and health equitypopulation health, health equity, and data science.</span></p>
<p>The integrated academic and professional approach to learning medicine is three-pronged:</p>
<p style="margin-left:51pt">1.         Structured research mentorship;</p>
<p style="margin-left:51pt">2.         Foundational courses in public health, health systems, and medicine;</p>
<p style="margin-left:51pt">3.         Freedom to choose additional courses that support your research.</p>
<p>This curriculum will not only support your research but also provide you with a critical perspective of the context in which you will practice medicine.</p>
<p>The following outline describes the course requirements for the JMP curriculum with a minimum of 32 credit units taken for your master’s in addition to the medical curriculum.</p>
<p><strong style="color:rgb(35, 31, 32); font-family:freight-micro-pro,serif; font-size:1.6em; font-weight:700">Curriculum</strong></p>
<p>The curriculum consists of foundational core courses and courses in two possible tracks selected by students. Master’s courses are taken in parallel with medical courses. Students should commit to a track once they identify a mentor and a project, which is expected by the end of the first year. The two tracks provide the curricular flexibility needed to accommodate various approaches to achieving the program’s goals. In other words, we recognize that the education of antiracist changemakers can be accomplished through different paths.</p>
<p>In the table below, the core required courses are shaded in green. The orange and purple shading in the table represent the two tracks. Track A (purple shading) focuses on changemaking through health policy and biomedical sciences. Track B (orange shading) focuses on changemaking through social science and humanities. The required methods course for track A is biostatistics; for track B, students, with their mentor’s advice, will select an appropriate methods course.</p>

<h3 class="Normal1">JMP Masters of Health &amp; Medical Sciences Thesis</h3>
<p class="Normal1">A JMP student’s MS coursework and research culminate in the crafting of a thesis, including an in-depth literature review of the student’s area of expertise and a scholarly product, often a manuscript for submission to a journal. Students can pursue research in any field of knowledge with a link to human health.  A database of prior JMP research theses can be accessed at: <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/ucb_ucsf_joint_medical_program" target="_blank">http://escholarship.org/uc/ucb_ucsf_joint_medical_program</a></p>

The focus of this course is on medical physiology—the study of the human body's normal functioning. Physiology underpins the rest of the foundational medical sciences curriculum by allowing students to map and anchor the additional learning necessary to make sense of complex problem-based learning (PBL) medical cases later in the curriculum. Students will learn physiology through team-based learning (TBL), a student-centered pedagogy in which they</span><span class="deschide"> work with physiological problems to solve them collaboratively. By actively engaging in learning through problem-solving, students do more than memorize content; they learn how to work together to build a strong web of interconnected information to solve real-world problems.</span><br/>

This is the second in a series of 5 courses designed to support graduate students’ development as scholars and medical learners with a critical stance. This course provides a scaffold for students to make progress on their master’s project work. To support this process, students will use class time to work in the context of their groups, which are assigned based on methodological affinity or topic affinity. Students can move between groups as needed, and new groups</span><span class="deschide"> may be formed when needed. Students will continue working on translating research questions into methods/research design, including appropriate measurements.</span><br/>

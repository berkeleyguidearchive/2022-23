				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p class="Default">The Environmental Science, Policy, and Management (ESPM) Graduate Program provides a wealth of opportunities for students interested in careers in academia, government, and non-governmental agencies worldwide. Our <a href="http://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/people/faculty-specialists/"><span class="Hyperlink1">faculty</span></a> are internationally recognized, and ESPM is the campus hub for connections to other renowned Berkeley programs in the environment such as the <a href="http://erg.berkeley.edu/"><span class="Hyperlink1">Energy and Resources Group</span></a>, <a href="http://areweb.berkeley.edu/"><span class="Hyperlink1">Agricultural and Resource Economics</span></a>, the <a href="http://gspp.berkeley.edu/"><span class="Hyperlink1">Goldman School of Public Policy</span></a>, <a href="https://ib.berkeley.edu"><span class="Hyperlink0">Integrative Biology</span></a>, <a href="http://bnhm.berkeley.edu/"><span class="Hyperlink1">Berkeley Natural History Museums</span></a><span class="Hyperlink1">,</span> and <a href="https://www.law.berkeley.edu"><span class="Hyperlink0">Berkeley Law</span></a>. The Berkeley campus maintains close ties to world-class research facilities at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, U.S. Geological Survey, California Academy of Sciences, Stanford University, and many other institutions. Students admitted to our program work with their research mentor to select courses, individualize their training, and conduct research projects that meet their interests and goals. Our core graduate courses provide an introduction to the wide breadth and deep expertise of research on the environment within our department and help students apply for funding opportunities early in their graduate program.</p>
<p class="Default">The <a href="https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/graduate-programs/degrees/the-phd-program"><span class="Hyperlink1">PhD program</span></a> is the main graduate program in ESPM for students entering with or without previous masters degrees, though we also offer limited numbers of MS degrees in our specialized <a href="http://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/graduate-programs/degrees/ms-range-management/"><span class="Hyperlink1">Master of Range Management</span></a> and <a href="https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/graduate-programs/degrees/master-of-forestry"><span class="Hyperlink1">Master of Forestry</span></a> programs. The goal of the program is to provide both a strong disciplinary education and broadly based experience in cross-disciplinary communication and problem solving. To achieve this, the program leading to the PhD in environmental science, policy, and management requires that students complete three core courses and take additional coursework in the following three areas: area of specialization, research skills, and experiential breadth.</p>
<h4>Disciplinary Emphasis</h4>
<p>The disciplinary emphasis is the broadest academic area encompassing the student's interests. The three disciplinary emphases within the department are ecosystem sciences, organisms &amp; environment, and society &amp; environment. A student pursuing a strongly interdisciplinary program may study more than one of these disciplines in depth. Specific coursework within each field will be chosen by the guiding committee in conjunction with the student and approved by the graduate mentor. </p>
<h4>Area of Specialization</h4>
<p>The area of specialization is a narrower field within the context of the disciplinary emphasis. Some examples of these areas are microbial community ecology, ecosystem function, arthropod population and community ecology, biological control of arthropods, arthropod biodiversity science, American environmental history and policy, international forest management, biogeochemistry, Mediterranean grassland ecosystems, remote sensing, and forest management, to name a few.</p>
<h4>Application</h4>
<p class="Default">Prospective graduate students are encouraged to contact a potential PhD mentor directly prior to the application deadline. If possible, prospective graduate students should plan to visit the campus, department, and graduate program. As part of their application, each student will be asked to identify one of the three disciplinary emphases (ecosystem sciences, organisms &amp; environment, and society &amp; environment) most closely associated with her/his interests. If you have questions about which emphasis to choose, please ask your prospective mentor. It is not uncommon for students in ESPM to be co-mentored by two professors, often with different disciplinary emphases. The area of specialization is determined after entry into the program, in consultation with the guiding committee and PhD mentor.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="admissionstext"></a><h2>Admissions</h2><h3 class="Normal1">Admission to the University</h3>
 <h4>Minimum Requirements for Admission</h4> <p>The following minimum requirements apply to all graduate programs and will be verified by the Graduate Division:</p> <ol> 	<li>A bachelor’s degree or recognized equivalent from an accredited institution;</li> 	<li>A grade point average of B or better (3.0);</li> 	<li>If the applicant has completed a basic degree from a country or political entity (e.g., Quebec) where English is not the official language, adequate proficiency in English to do graduate work, as evidenced by a TOEFL score of at least 90 on the iBT test, 570 on the paper-and-pencil test, or an IELTS Band score of at least 7 on a 9-point scale (note that individual programs may set higher levels for any of these); and</li> 	<li>Sufficient undergraduate training to do graduate work in the given field.</li> </ol> <h4>Applicants Who Already Hold a Graduate Degree</h4> <p>The Graduate Council views academic degrees not as vocational training certificates, but as evidence of broad training in research methods, independent study, and articulation of learning. Therefore, applicants who already have academic graduate degrees should be able to pursue new subject matter at an advanced level without the need to enroll in a related or similar graduate program.</p> <p>Programs may consider students for an additional academic master’s or professional master’s degree only if the additional degree is in a distinctly different field.</p> <p>Applicants admitted to a doctoral program that requires a master’s degree to be earned at Berkeley as a prerequisite (even though the applicant already has a master’s degree from another institution in the same or a closely allied field of study) will be permitted to undertake the second master’s degree, despite the overlap in field.</p> <p>The Graduate Division will admit students for a second doctoral degree only if they meet the following guidelines:</p> <ol> 	<li>Applicants with doctoral degrees may be admitted for an additional doctoral degree only if that degree program is in a general area of knowledge distinctly different from the field in which they earned their original degree. For example, a physics PhD could be admitted to a doctoral degree program in music or history; however, a student with a doctoral degree in mathematics would not be permitted to add a PhD in statistics.</li> 	<li>Applicants who hold the PhD degree may be admitted to a professional doctorate or professional master’s degree program if there is no duplication of training involved.</li> </ol> <p>Applicants may apply only to one single degree program or one concurrent degree program per admission cycle.</p> <h4>Required Documents for Applications</h4> <ol> 	<li><strong>Transcripts: </strong>Applicants may upload <em>unofficial </em>transcripts with your application for the departmental initial review. Unofficial transcripts must contain specific information including the name of the applicant, name of the school, all courses, grades, units, &amp; degree conferral (if applicable). </li> 	<li><strong>Letters of recommendation:</strong> Applicants may request online letters of recommendation through the online application system. Hard copies of recommendation letters must be sent directly to the program, by the recommender, not the Graduate Admissions.</li> 	<li> 	<p><strong><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">Evidence of English language proficiency:</span> </strong>All applicants who have completed a basic degree from a country or political entity in which the official language is not English are required to submit official evidence of English language proficiency. This applies to institutions from Bangladesh, Burma, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Latin America, the Middle East, the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, most European countries, and Quebec (Canada). However, applicants who, at the time of application, have already completed at least one year of full-time academic course work with grades of B or better at a US university may submit an official transcript from the US university to fulfill this requirement. The following courses will not fulfill this requirement:</p> 	<ul> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses in English as a Second Language,</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses conducted in a language other than English,</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses that will be completed after the application is submitted, and</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses of a non-academic nature.</span></p> 		</li> 	</ul> 	</li> </ol> <p style="margin-left:30pt"><span><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">Applicants who have previously applied to Berkeley must also submit new test scores that meet the current minimum requirement from one of the standardized tests. Official TOEFL score reports must be sent directly from Educational Test Services (ETS). The institution code for Berkeley is 4833 for Graduate Organizations. Official IELTS score reports must be sent electronically from the testing center to University of California, Berkeley, Graduate Division, Sproul Hall, Rm 318 MC 5900, Berkeley, CA 94720. TOEFL and IELTS score reports are only valid for two years prior to beginning the graduate program at UC Berkeley. </span></span>Note: score reports can not expire before the month of June.</p> <div> </div> <h4>Where to Apply</h4> <p>Visit the Berkeley Graduate Division <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply/" target="_blank">application page</a>. </p>
<h3 class="Normal1">Admission to the Program</h3>
<p>Applicants for admission to the graduate program must hold a bachelor's degree from a university or college with curricula and standards equivalent to those of the University of California. The completed undergraduate program should normally be in a field relevant to the disciplinary emphasis chosen. Applicants without this background may be admitted with the understanding that their coursework must compensate for deficiencies in their preparation. We suggest that prospective applicants consult with faculty or the <a href="https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/graduate-student-services" target="_blank">Graduate Student Services Office</a> for advice and course recommendations.</p>
<p>Prospective graduate students are encouraged to contact a potential PhD mentor directly prior to the application deadline. If possible, prospective graduate students should plan to visit the campus, department, and graduate program. </p>
<p>It is critical that all applicants identify on their application faculty whose research and work overlap with their strengths and interests. Without this information, the admission committee will not be able to evaluate your application properly. <em><strong>Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact faculty prior to the application process. </strong></em>As part of their application, each student will be asked to identify one of the three disciplinary emphases (ecosystem sciences, organisms &amp; environment, and society &amp; environment) most closely associated with her/his interests. If you have questions about which emphasis to choose, please ask your prospective mentor.  Faculty sponsorship of entering graduate students will be determined once all applications have been reviewed and final admission offers have been made.</p>
<p><em>The ESPM admission committee, not individual faculty, makes the final decisions on who will be offered admission to the program. </em>Applications are accepted for the fall semester only.</p>

Writing is one of the most compelling skills we learn as environmental scientists and communicators. Yet, the formulaic and monotonous nature of composing scientific peer-reviewed publications can constrain creative and imaginative prose, features of our writing that draw in audiences outside academia. The goal of this graduate seminar is to provide a broad, introductory exploration to creative and environmental science writing. We will explore</span><span class="deschide">, discuss, and workshop multiple literary genres – from poetry to creative fiction and nonfiction – as both a means of diversifying our writing craft and improving narrative structure in academic writing.</span><br/>

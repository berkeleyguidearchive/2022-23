<![CDATA[
<p class="Normal1">The Department of Mechanical Engineering offers three graduate degree programs: the Master of Engineering (M.Eng), the Master of Science (M.S.), and the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.).</p>
<h3>Master of Engineering (M.Eng)</h3>
<p class="normal1">This accelerated Masters of Engineering Program has been designed in collaboration with several other departments in the College of Engineering for the purpose of developing professional leaders who understand the technical, environmental, economic, and social issues involved in Mechanical Engineering. It is supported by the College of Engineering's Coleman Fung Institute for Engineering Leadership. For more information about this interdisciplinary program, please see the <a href="http://funginstitute.berkeley.edu/">Fung Institute Website</a>.</p>
<p class="normal1">There are full-time and part-time options for pursuing this program.</p>
<h3>Master of Science (M.S.)</h3>
<p>The MS degree can be earned only in conjunction with a Ph.D. (for the MS/PhD option) as application for the terminal M.S. is currently paused. Degrees are granted after completion of a program of study that emphasizes the application of the natural sciences to the analysis and solution of engineering problems. Advanced courses in engineering, math, and the sciences are normally included in a program that incorporates the engineering systems approach for the analysis of problems.</p>
<h3>Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.)</h3>
<p class="Normal1">This degree can be completed in conjunction with a master of science degree or alone. Degrees are granted after completion of programs of study that emphasize the application of the natural sciences to the analysis and solution of engineering problems. Advanced courses in mathematics, chemistry, physics, and the life sciences are normally included in a program that incorporates the engineering systems approach for the analysis of problems.</p>

<h3>Admission to the University</h3>
 <h4>Minimum Requirements for Admission</h4> <p>The following minimum requirements apply to all graduate programs and will be verified by the Graduate Division:</p> <ol> 	<li>A bachelor’s degree or recognized equivalent from an accredited institution;</li> 	<li>A grade point average of B or better (3.0);</li> 	<li>If the applicant has completed a basic degree from a country or political entity (e.g., Quebec) where English is not the official language, adequate proficiency in English to do graduate work, as evidenced by a TOEFL score of at least 90 on the iBT test, 570 on the paper-and-pencil test, or an IELTS Band score of at least 7 on a 9-point scale (note that individual programs may set higher levels for any of these); and</li> 	<li>Sufficient undergraduate training to do graduate work in the given field.</li> </ol> <h4>Applicants Who Already Hold a Graduate Degree</h4> <p>The Graduate Council views academic degrees not as vocational training certificates, but as evidence of broad training in research methods, independent study, and articulation of learning. Therefore, applicants who already have academic graduate degrees should be able to pursue new subject matter at an advanced level without the need to enroll in a related or similar graduate program.</p> <p>Programs may consider students for an additional academic master’s or professional master’s degree only if the additional degree is in a distinctly different field.</p> <p>Applicants admitted to a doctoral program that requires a master’s degree to be earned at Berkeley as a prerequisite (even though the applicant already has a master’s degree from another institution in the same or a closely allied field of study) will be permitted to undertake the second master’s degree, despite the overlap in field.</p> <p>The Graduate Division will admit students for a second doctoral degree only if they meet the following guidelines:</p> <ol> 	<li>Applicants with doctoral degrees may be admitted for an additional doctoral degree only if that degree program is in a general area of knowledge distinctly different from the field in which they earned their original degree. For example, a physics PhD could be admitted to a doctoral degree program in music or history; however, a student with a doctoral degree in mathematics would not be permitted to add a PhD in statistics.</li> 	<li>Applicants who hold the PhD degree may be admitted to a professional doctorate or professional master’s degree program if there is no duplication of training involved.</li> </ol> <p>Applicants may apply only to one single degree program or one concurrent degree program per admission cycle.</p> <h4>Required Documents for Applications</h4> <ol> 	<li><strong>Transcripts: </strong>Applicants may upload <em>unofficial </em>transcripts with your application for the departmental initial review. Unofficial transcripts must contain specific information including the name of the applicant, name of the school, all courses, grades, units, &amp; degree conferral (if applicable). </li> 	<li><strong>Letters of recommendation:</strong> Applicants may request online letters of recommendation through the online application system. Hard copies of recommendation letters must be sent directly to the program, by the recommender, not the Graduate Admissions.</li> 	<li> 	<p><strong><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">Evidence of English language proficiency:</span> </strong>All applicants who have completed a basic degree from a country or political entity in which the official language is not English are required to submit official evidence of English language proficiency. This applies to institutions from Bangladesh, Burma, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Latin America, the Middle East, the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, most European countries, and Quebec (Canada). However, applicants who, at the time of application, have already completed at least one year of full-time academic course work with grades of B or better at a US university may submit an official transcript from the US university to fulfill this requirement. The following courses will not fulfill this requirement:</p> 	<ul> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses in English as a Second Language,</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses conducted in a language other than English,</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses that will be completed after the application is submitted, and</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses of a non-academic nature.</span></p> 		</li> 	</ul> 	</li> </ol> <p style="margin-left:30pt"><span><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">Applicants who have previously applied to Berkeley must also submit new test scores that meet the current minimum requirement from one of the standardized tests. Official TOEFL score reports must be sent directly from Educational Test Services (ETS). The institution code for Berkeley is 4833 for Graduate Organizations. Official IELTS score reports must be sent electronically from the testing center to University of California, Berkeley, Graduate Division, Sproul Hall, Rm 318 MC 5900, Berkeley, CA 94720. TOEFL and IELTS score reports are only valid for two years prior to beginning the graduate program at UC Berkeley. </span></span>Note: score reports can not expire before the month of June.</p> <div> </div> <h4>Where to Apply</h4> <p>Visit the Berkeley Graduate Division <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply/" target="_blank">application page</a>. </p>

<h6>Fluids and Ocean (NEW)</h6>
<p>This track provides graduates with a firm foundation in analytical, computational, and experimental essentials of fluid dynamics. Research activities span the Reynolds number range from creeping flows to planetary phenomena. Topics of current study include suspension mechanics, dynamics of phase changes (in engineering and in geophysical flows), earth mantle dynamics, interfacial phenomena, non-Newtonian fluid mechanics, biofluid mechanics, vascular flows, chaotic mixing and transport of scalars, bubble dynamics, environmental fluid dynamics, aerodynamics, vortex dynamics and breakdown, aircraft wake vortices, rotating flows, stability and transition, chaos, turbulence, shock dynamics, sonoluminescence, sonochemistry, reacting flows, planetary atmospheres, ship waves, internal waves, and nonlinear wave-vorticity interaction. One key application area is Ocean Engineering, which involves the development, design, and analysis of man-made systems that can operate in the offshore or coastal environment. Such systems may be used for transportation, recreation, fisheries, extraction of petroleum or other minerals, and recovery of thermal or wave energy, among others. Some systems are bottom-mounted, particularly those in shallower depths; others are mobile, as in the case of ships, submersibles, or floating drill rigs. All systems should be designed to withstand a hostile environment (wind, waves, currents, ice) and to operate efficiently while staying environmentally friendly.</p>

<h6>Mechanics and Dynamics (NEW)</h6>
<p>Having its roots in the classical theory of elastic materials, solid mechanics has grown to embrace all aspects involving the behavior of deformable bodies under loads. Thus, in addition to including the theory of linear elasticity, with its applications to structural materials, solid mechanics also incorporates modern nonlinear theories of highly deformable materials. This includes synthetic polymeric materials, as well as biological materials. Our program also includes other aspects of continuum mechanics including approximate theories (such as those involving moderate strains or moderate rotations) and the Lagrangian representation of vorticity. The behavior of continua that are almost rigid, with a view to characterizing their dynamical characteristics, is also an important top.</p>

<h6>Modeling and Simulation  OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING PROCESSES</h6>
<p><span style="font-size:1em">Modern manufacturing can be characterized by three basic processing strategies – additive, subtractive and near-net shape. These are somewhat self-explanatory in their names. Near-net shape, aka forming/forging and molding techniques. Subtractive, for example, machining, is the “old standby” process used extensively in basic machine construction but is quite limited as applied to higher technology products. Additive manufacturing, ranging from deposition processes to the more recent rapid prototyping approaches, is an area that offers much future potential for both accurate and fast creation of complex products. Additive manufacturing (AM) and Rapid-Prototyping (RP) have received a great deal of attention for a number of years. In particular, the idea of 3-D Printing (3DP) has received quite a large amount of press. According to ASTM, AM is defined as the “process of joining materials to make objects from  3D model data, usually layer upon layer, as opposed to subtractive manufacturing methodologies. This track provides you with the sophisticated mathematical modeling skills critical to the manufacturing of advanced devices and systems across all sectors and industries. You will gain experience creating the tools that are used in an array of technologies that employ advanced manufacturing and 3D printing.</span></p>

This course explores contemporary research in engineering design and prototyping, as well as related cognitive issues in engineering curricular development, pedagogy, and assessment. One recurring theme throughout the course will be the duality between learning and design: design-based research, design as a pedagogy for integrative learning and the role of cognition and the learning sciences in the practice of engineering design. It has been motivated by several</span><span class="deschide"> reforms: (1) National efforts to better train and educate engineers for the engineering workplace in the 21st Century: to better prepare engineers to face multidisciplinary problems and product design in competitive industries and improve their skills in teamwork and communication.</span><br/>

The focus of the course is management of innovation processes for sustainable products, from product definition to sustainable manufacturing and financial models. Using a project in which students will be asked to design and develop a product or service focused on sustainability, we will teach processes for collecting customer and user needs data, prioritizing that data, developing a product specification, sketching and building product prototypes</span><span class="deschide">, and interacting with the customer/community during product development. The course is intended as a very hands-on experience in the &quot;green&quot; product development process. The course will be a Management of Technology course offered jointly with the College of Engineering and the Haas School of Business. In addition, it will also receive credit towards the new Certificate on Engineering Sustainability and Environmental Management program. We aim to have half MBA students and half Engineering students (with a few other students, such as from the School of Information) in the class. The instructors will facilitate students to form mixed disciplinary reams for the development of their &quot;green&quot; products.</span><br/>

They will learn how to write research proposals and how to give an effective presentation. Through the research proposals, students will learn about the scientific-research process: formulating the problem, determining the appropriate experimental methods, interpreting the results, and arriving at a conclusion. Through presentations, students will gain valuable experience in public speaking and learn the process by which they would have to propose a research problem, be it in academia or industry.</p></div>

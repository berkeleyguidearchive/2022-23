				<a name="admissionstext"></a><h2>Admissions</h2><h3 class="Normal1">Admission to the University</h3>
 <h4>Minimum Requirements for Admission</h4> <p>The following minimum requirements apply to all graduate programs and will be verified by the Graduate Division:</p> <ol> 	<li>A bachelor’s degree or recognized equivalent from an accredited institution;</li> 	<li>A grade point average of B or better (3.0);</li> 	<li>If the applicant has completed a basic degree from a country or political entity (e.g., Quebec) where English is not the official language, adequate proficiency in English to do graduate work, as evidenced by a TOEFL score of at least 90 on the iBT test, 570 on the paper-and-pencil test, or an IELTS Band score of at least 7 on a 9-point scale (note that individual programs may set higher levels for any of these); and</li> 	<li>Sufficient undergraduate training to do graduate work in the given field.</li> </ol> <h4>Applicants Who Already Hold a Graduate Degree</h4> <p>The Graduate Council views academic degrees not as vocational training certificates, but as evidence of broad training in research methods, independent study, and articulation of learning. Therefore, applicants who already have academic graduate degrees should be able to pursue new subject matter at an advanced level without the need to enroll in a related or similar graduate program.</p> <p>Programs may consider students for an additional academic master’s or professional master’s degree only if the additional degree is in a distinctly different field.</p> <p>Applicants admitted to a doctoral program that requires a master’s degree to be earned at Berkeley as a prerequisite (even though the applicant already has a master’s degree from another institution in the same or a closely allied field of study) will be permitted to undertake the second master’s degree, despite the overlap in field.</p> <p>The Graduate Division will admit students for a second doctoral degree only if they meet the following guidelines:</p> <ol> 	<li>Applicants with doctoral degrees may be admitted for an additional doctoral degree only if that degree program is in a general area of knowledge distinctly different from the field in which they earned their original degree. For example, a physics PhD could be admitted to a doctoral degree program in music or history; however, a student with a doctoral degree in mathematics would not be permitted to add a PhD in statistics.</li> 	<li>Applicants who hold the PhD degree may be admitted to a professional doctorate or professional master’s degree program if there is no duplication of training involved.</li> </ol> <p>Applicants may apply only to one single degree program or one concurrent degree program per admission cycle.</p> <h4>Required Documents for Applications</h4> <ol> 	<li><strong>Transcripts: </strong>Applicants may upload <em>unofficial </em>transcripts with your application for the departmental initial review. Unofficial transcripts must contain specific information including the name of the applicant, name of the school, all courses, grades, units, &amp; degree conferral (if applicable). </li> 	<li><strong>Letters of recommendation:</strong> Applicants may request online letters of recommendation through the online application system. Hard copies of recommendation letters must be sent directly to the program, by the recommender, not the Graduate Admissions.</li> 	<li> 	<p><strong><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">Evidence of English language proficiency:</span> </strong>All applicants who have completed a basic degree from a country or political entity in which the official language is not English are required to submit official evidence of English language proficiency. This applies to institutions from Bangladesh, Burma, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Latin America, the Middle East, the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, most European countries, and Quebec (Canada). However, applicants who, at the time of application, have already completed at least one year of full-time academic course work with grades of B or better at a US university may submit an official transcript from the US university to fulfill this requirement. The following courses will not fulfill this requirement:</p> 	<ul> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses in English as a Second Language,</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses conducted in a language other than English,</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses that will be completed after the application is submitted, and</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses of a non-academic nature.</span></p> 		</li> 	</ul> 	</li> </ol> <p style="margin-left:30pt"><span><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">Applicants who have previously applied to Berkeley must also submit new test scores that meet the current minimum requirement from one of the standardized tests. Official TOEFL score reports must be sent directly from Educational Test Services (ETS). The institution code for Berkeley is 4833 for Graduate Organizations. Official IELTS score reports must be sent electronically from the testing center to University of California, Berkeley, Graduate Division, Sproul Hall, Rm 318 MC 5900, Berkeley, CA 94720. TOEFL and IELTS score reports are only valid for two years prior to beginning the graduate program at UC Berkeley. </span></span>Note: score reports can not expire before the month of June.</p> <div> </div> <h4>Where to Apply</h4> <p>Visit the Berkeley Graduate Division <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply/" target="_blank">application page</a>. </p>

<p class="Normal1"><span class="details-value">The Political Science department at UC Berkeley admits students for the doctoral degree only. The PhD program has two major phases: (1) coursework and examinations, and (2) dissertation research and writing. </span>The two phases typically take approximately five or six years (three years to candidacy and two or three for dissertation research and writing).</p>
<h3>Time to Advancement</h3>

</tbody></table>

<p>The coursework and examination phase requires 40 units (typically 10 classes) of graduate-level coursework and competence in three of eleven <a href="http://polisci.berkeley.edu/research-and-teaching/subfields" target="_blank" title="Subfields">subfields</a>. Subfield competence is demonstrated through coursework and written exams offered each semester. A Preliminary Field Examination is typically taken in the student’s second or third year of the program. All students must pass one exam in one of the following subfields: American Politics, Comparative Politics, International Relations, Methodology, Models and Politics, or Political Theory. All students must also demonstrate competency in two additional subfields, by taking a minimum of three to four courses in two of the following areas: American Politics, Comparative Politics, International Relations, Political Theory, Methodology, Models and Politics, Area Studies, Political Behavior, Political Economy, Public Policy &amp; Organization, Race &amp; Ethnic Politics, and Interdisciplinary Studies in Political Thought. Other appropriate subfields may be designated by the department. Students must achieve a combined GPA of 3.5 in these courses.</p>
<p>The particular sequence of courses that a student takes in preparation for the comprehensive field exam is not prescribed. Rather, the faculty assist students with a selection of courses that best meet their intellectual and academic interests. There are no formal foreign language or statistics requirements although many students will find that their program of study and dissertation research will require the engagement of particular foreign language or methodology coursework.</p>
<p>When the coursework and preliminary examination requirements have been met, the student prepares a prospectus for dissertation research. The student convenes a committee known as the Qualifying Examination Committee, consisting of four faculty members. The Qualifying Examination Committee advises on the prospectus and examines the student on specific research plans. UC Berkeley is highly committed to interdisciplinary scholarly engagement and the student may elect to include faculty members from another department or unit at UC Berkeley on both their Qualifying Examination Committee and Dissertation Committee. Engagement with members of the faculty from other departments should begin during the coursework stage so that the advice and input of the outside member are represented in the prospectus.</p>
<p>When sufficient preparation for the proposed research has been demonstrated to the Qualifying Examination Committee, the student is advanced to doctoral candidacy. It is expected (and for most funding packages, required) that the student advance to doctoral candidacy by the end of their third year.</p>
<h4 class="Normal1">Dissertation Research and Writing</h4>
<p>Doctoral candidacy initiates the second phase of the program during which the student normally devotes full attention to the research and writing of the dissertation. The student's Dissertation Committee is typically comprised of the members from the Qualifying Examination Committee although there are sometimes changes in committee membership as the research evolves. The doctorate is awarded when the student submits a satisfactory dissertation to the dissertation committee.  There is no formal dissertation defense at Berkeley. A reasonable estimate of the research and writing phase of the program is approximately two to three years although students whose dissertations require more extensive research may take longer to earn their degree.</p>
<h4 class="Normal1">General Curriculum Guidelines</h4>
<h5>First Year</h5>
<p>Students are required to complete 24 units of coursework in their first year of study. At least 12 of these units must be in political science graduate courses; the remainder may be in graduate or upper division undergraduate courses in other departments. The first year is designed to allow the student the opportunity to engage in foreign language study, area specialization, and to meet and study with faculty from other departments who may become members of the qualifying exam or dissertation committees. All students are reviewed at the end of the first year of study on their overall academic performance. This overall evaluation will include GPA and successful completion of all 24 required units. In exceptional cases, a student may decide not to continue in the PhD program or may be asked to leave after the first year; in this event, students may either be awarded an MA degree (if they complete the requirements for the degree, see next item) or will leave the program without an MA degree.</p>
<h5>Second Year</h5>
<p>During the second year, students must complete an advanced topical research essay, the second year paper.  The student will narrow their interests, continue to explore ideas for a dissertation topic, and identify potential advisers. Coursework continues as students begin preparing for both preliminary field exams and writing their dissertation prospectus. Additionally, students in their second year usually serve as a graduate student instructor (GSI), a 20 hour per week position.  </p>
<h5>Third Year</h5>
<p>During the third year, most students continue to teach as GSIs and complete their coursework in addition to taking their field exams. Political Science graduate students must show competency in three subfield specialties to be eligible to sit for the oral prospectus defense (known formally as the Qualifying Exam). Students must pass a written Preliminary Field Examination in one subfield and “course out” of two other subfields by taking a prescribed set of courses in each.</p>
<p>Students may sit for their Preliminary Field Examination as early as the beginning of their second year, and if necessary, as late as winter of their third year. Field exams are offered at the beginning of the fall and spring semesters. All students are expected to have completed one field exam, “coursed out” out of two additional fields, and written &amp; defended their dissertation prospectus (pass their qualifying exam) by the end of the third year. It is highly recommended (and essential to most funding packages) that students advance to doctoral candidacy by the end of their third year. The third year is also when students should begin to apply for extramural fellowships to support their dissertation research.</p>
<h5>Fourth Year</h5>
<p>Beginning in the third year and continuing into the fourth, students should be collecting much of the information and data necessary for their dissertation. Many students spend one or both semesters of their fourth year conducting research, many going abroad to do field work.</p>
<h5>Fifth Year</h5>
<p>Like the fourth year, the fifth year is variable according to an individual's research schedule. Often this is a good year to use the Dean’s Completion Fellowship while focusing on writing the dissertation. This is also the time, if research is complete and writing has begun, to apply for finishing fellowships and extramural dissertation awards. Ideally, if students plan to enter the job market during the fifth year, they should have most of their dissertation completed by then. </p>
<h5>Sixth Year and Beyond</h5>
<p>Students are normally expected to finish by their sixth year. In the sixth year, students continue to work on completing and revising the dissertation and enter the job market. This is also a time students apply for post-doctoral fellowships. To fund the final year(s), some students teach as adjunct faculty at the many colleges and universities in the area, and some find research assistantships.</p>
<h4 class="Normal1">Subfields</h4>
<h5>American Politics</h5>
<p>Subfield Coordinator: Gabriel Lenz</p>
<p>The study of American politics at Berkeley brings together faculty and graduate students who seek to tackle the most important questions confronting the field using diverse methodological approaches.</p>
<p>Among other topics, the faculty’s research agenda encompasses the quality and meaning of representation in contemporary American politics, the political implications of rising economic inequality, the politics of immigration and of minority group representation, the meaning of American national identity, the sources and implications of party polarization, the development of American bureaucratic government and of the American welfare state, and the balance of power among Congress, the Presidency, and the Courts. Our program strives to train students to have a diverse methodological toolkit, including quantitative, historical/developmental, game-theoretic, behavioral, and institutional approaches.</p>
<p>The department supports several workshops and colloquia that foster this diverse intellectual community, including the American Politics Research Workshop, the Positive Political Theory seminar series, the Race, Ethnicity, and Immigration Colloquium, the American Political Development working group, and the Quantitative Methods Workshop. These research units also provide funding for graduate student research projects and for faculty-student collaboration. Faculty work closely with students to help each student carve out a research agenda that fits his or her interests, while addressing a substantively important problem.</p>
<h5>Comparative Politics</h5>
<p>Subfield Coordinator: Alison Post</p>
<p>Berkeley has a longstanding tradition of distinction in comparative politics. Members of the department’s comparative politics faculty are widely recognized as national and international leaders, and the department’s strengths have grown in recent years.</p>
<p>The coverage of substantive themes, methodological approaches, and geographic expertise is extremely broad. Comparative political economy, political regimes and regime change, political parties and organizations, and social mobilization are the subject of great interest among faculty and graduate students. Some comparative faculty and graduate students rely largely upon formal theory in their work. Some are highly proficient in quantitative methods, while others use case studies and qualitative methods. Many faculty and graduate students use multi-method approaches. The faculty emphasizes rigor of method—whether applied in formal, statistical, or qualitative work. All graduate students in comparative politics are expected to achieve proficiency in all methods prevalent in the field.</p>
<p>The faculty and graduate student populations are diverse; no single theoretical orientation or methodology enjoys status as orthodoxy. Generally speaking, Berkeley comparativists pursue “big” questions that have broad implications for political life and public policy as well as social science. Such questions include when and why Chinese peasants resist unjust authority; how transformations in the global economy are reshaping the welfare state in advanced industrialized countries; how economic structures and resource flows mold state and market institutions; why economic liberalization has proved difficult in Japan and how it may yet come about; why democracy is failing in Russia while working in Indonesia; why opposition forces succeed in forging electoral alliances in some African polities but not others; how party systems influence the provision of public goods across the Indian states; and how labor organizations are responding to transformations in economic policy in Latin America.</p>
<h5>International Relations</h5>
<p>Subfield Coordinator: Vinod Aggarwal</p>
<p>International Relations at Berkeley focuses on the study of contemporary and historical problems in world politics. Our faculty and graduate students work on an eclectic set of substantive issues that frequently cross over between international relations theory, security studies, and international political economy.</p>
<p>Current research interests pursued by our group include the causes and consequences of peace and war, the political economy of trade and finance, American foreign and national security policy, emerging issues in security, geopolitical order and change, the impact of technology and geography on world politics, the role of ideas and identities shaping international affairs, the link between business and politics, and the interaction between religion and global politics. In addition to resources in the Political Science Department, our work is reflected and supported by various centers across campus: the Institute for International Studies (IIS), the Berkeley Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Study Center (BASC), the Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy (BRIE), the Religion, Politics and Globalization Program (RPGP), Evidence in Governance and Politics (EGAP) and others. In addition, the journal <em>Business and Politics</em> is edited by one of our faculty members.</p>
<p>Our methodologies are equally eclectic, ranging from socio-historical analysis to quantitative empirics and formal modeling. Much of our research is interdisciplinary, drawing from fields as disparate as economics, psychology, ecology, theology, or history. We take theory seriously but not to the exclusion of interesting and important global problems. Our overarching goal is to contribute to an understanding of how international politics is organized and how it functions around substantive issues that matter to political actors and human beings.</p>
<h5>Methodology &amp; Formal Theory</h5>
<p>Subfield Coordinator: Thad Dunning</p>
<p>The Berkeley program in empirical methodology and formal theory offers rigorous training that is carefully integrated with major substantive agendas in political science.</p>
<p>The program builds centrally on innovative faculty research, which encompasses new methods for causal inference and program evaluation, as well as statistical computing and survey analysis. The work on surveys has included path-breaking contributions to developing and refining experiments embedded in surveys and computer-assisted telephone interviewing; and innovations in measuring issue orientations and in multi-level modeling of political behavior. In formal theory, faculty have contributed to opening new lines of inquiry into strategic interactions where formal institutions are weak, and to modeling information and incentives in organiza­tions—as they affect both the dynamics of institutions within the United States and those in authoritarian and democratizing regimes. Faculty in both tradi­tions play a promi­nent role in developing empirical tests of formal theory, based on both laboratory experiments and obser­va­tional data. The faculty has also done influential work on qua­litative meth­odology, compa­rative-historical methods, and linking qualitative methods with both quantitative tools and with formal analysis.</p>
<p>The methods/formal faculty make important institutional contributions on the Berkeley campus. They convene the Positive Political Theory Seminar, which draws together a national consti­tuency of leading modelers for its biweekly meetings. They have led the campus Survey Research Center and helped to sustain its innovative research on survey methodo­logy; and they were central to launching the Berkeley’s NSF/IGERT training program in Politics, Economics, Psychology, and Public Policy (PEPPP). Berkeley’s Institute of Govern­mental Studies, as well as the Survey Research Center, are important venues for convening scholars and graduate students, and they provide support for graduate students pursuing methodological and formal training.</p>
<p>Faculty members also play leading roles in the national political science profession. Their contri­butions have included serving as Chair of the Board of the American National Elections Studies (ANES); providing crucial leadership in launching the NSF program on the Empirical Implications of Theoretical Models (EITM); co-editing the new Oxford Handbook of Political Methodology; serving as President of the Political Methodology Society; and founding APSA’s Organized Section for Qualitative and Multi-Method Research. The political science department maintains close ties with the national Institute for Qualitative/Multi-Method Research, and many graduate students attend the institute. Three of the methods/formal faculty are Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p>
<h5>Political Theory &amp; Philosophy</h5>
<p>Subfield Coordinator: Kinch Hoekstra</p>
<p>Berkeley’s department offers a full range of courses in political theory, including classical, modern, and contemporary political philosophy (both European and American).</p>
<p>In the history of political thought, faculty have particular strengths in ancient moral and political thought, renaissance and early modern political thought, Enlightenment social and political thought, and nineteenth and twentieth century Marxism, British and Continental theory, and critical theory. In contemporary political theory, their areas of expertise include liberal and democratic thought, sovereignty and multiculturalism, and postfoundational approaches to subjectivity and social inquiry.</p>
<p>The core curriculum for graduate study in the department involves those courses recommended in preparation for the qualifying exam in the history of political thought (such courses include <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POL%20SCI%20212A" title="POL SCI 212A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POL SCI 212A');">POL SCI 212A</a></span> <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POL%20SCI%20212B" title="POL SCI 212B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POL SCI 212B');">POL SCI 212B</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POL%20SCI%20212C" title="POL SCI 212C" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POL SCI 212C');">POL SCI 212C</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POL%20SCI%20213" title="POL SCI 213" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POL SCI 213');">POL SCI 213</a></span>, and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POL%20SCI%20214" title="POL SCI 214" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POL SCI 214');">POL SCI 214</a></span>); and courses of special relevance to the qualifying exam in contemporary political theory (including <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POL%20SCI%20215A" title="POL SCI 215A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POL SCI 215A');">POL SCI 215A</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POL%20SCI%20215B" title="POL SCI 215B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POL SCI 215B');">POL SCI 215B</a></span>, and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POL%20SCI%20216" title="POL SCI 216" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POL SCI 216');">POL SCI 216</a></span>). The history of political thought exam has two parts. Part I queries students about the nature of the history of Western political thought as a field of knowledge, and/or about debates focused on particular periods or problems. Part II of the exam asks students to respond to questions about particular theorists or texts in each of three major time periods (ancient and medieval; early modern; modern). The contemporary political thought exam approaches twentieth and twenty-first-century political theory from three angles: subfields of theory, theorists and approaches, and topics.</p>
<p>The research, writing, and pedagogical interests of faculty within political theory are impressively varied. Greater details about the work and interests of each faculty member may be found on their faculty web pages.</p>
<h5>Models &amp; Politics</h5>
<p>Subfield Coordinator: Sean Gailmard</p>
<p>Formal models are used in political science as abstract representations of political institutions and choices in order to focus attention on key logic and causal mechanisms in a political process. Good modeling requires fluency in technical fields such as game theory and social choice theory, as well as the substantive knowledge to craft an appropriate and insightful model for a specific application.</p>
<p>The Models &amp; Politics subfield, instituted by the faculty in 2007, connects advanced training in formal modeling techniques (also commonly referred to as formal theory, positive political theory, or political economy) with innovative substantive research in political science. It is designed for students who plan to make significant use of formal modeling in their own research in American Politics, Comparative Politics, International Relations, or Political Theory. This subfield is appropriate for students who wish to use formal models to structure and inform their empirical research, as well as those who wish to become pure modelers.</p>
<h5>Political Behavior</h5>
<p>Subfield Coordinator: Gabriel Lenz</p>
<p>Political behavior at UC Berkeley serves as a bridge between political science on the one side and political psychology and political sociology on the other. Its focus is on the social and psychological processes by which individuals (and groups) engage in political life. Although the actual studies of these matters may occur within a particular geographical or institutional context and data are most often drawn from the American experience, the purpose is to generalize to a class of political phenomena or behavior beyond specific countries or specific institutions. Attention is also paid to problems of survey design and analysis, the development of scales, indices, and other measurement devices, questionnaire construction, interviewing, sampling, and other elements of systematic research that aim to yield data susceptible to statistical analysis. Among the substantive topics covered in the field are: public opinion; political leadership; political participation and protest and personality and politics.</p>
<p><strong>PUBLIC LAW &amp; JURISPRUDENCE</strong></p>
<p>Subfield Coordinator: To be determined</p>
<p>Public Law is concerned with the analysis of the actual behavior of legal decision-makers and the law-related behavior of citizens, as well as with the study of legal and constitutional doctrine. It seeks to develop an understanding of the role of law, legal theory, and legal practice in the governmental process. Courses and faculty research focus primarily on how the actions of legal decision-makers (like judges, police, regulatory officials, and bureaucrats) are shaped both by legal doctrine and philosophy and by political, organizational, economic, and social variables. Students are also expected to develop a knowledge of American Constitutional Law, its political ramifications, and its relation to public theory. Joint work with the UC Berkeley School of Law and its program in Jurisprudence and Social Policy is encouraged.</p>
<h5>Public Policy &amp; Organization</h5>
<p>Subfield Coordinator: Christopher Ansell</p>
<p>Public policy studies explore political responses to specific public problems, like environmental degradation, poverty, or disease. Faculty in this subfield are interested in the political dynamics of policy-making and policy implementation, including such topics as agenda-setting, regulatory decision-making, and federalism. Since public problems often ignore jurisdictions, a policy-oriented approach to political science is often concerned about the interplay between different levels of government (local, regional, national, and international). The Public Policy &amp; Organization subfield, therefore, draws on and contributes to scholarship in urban politics, American politics, comparative politics, and international relations.</p>
<p>Policy outcomes are typically mediated by organizations that mobilize stakeholders, make authoritative decisions, administer programs, and enforce laws. These organizations range from complex government bureaucracies to professional associations and social movement organizations. The organizational and inter-organizational aspects of policy-making and policy implementation are a particular concern of this subfield. Important debates in this field often focus on understanding how specific institutional arrangements are created to govern policy arenas and on whether these institutions produce effective, efficient, and equitable governance.</p>
<p>Sophisticated explanations of policy-making and implementation call for specific analytical tools and intellectual frameworks. This subfield draws on theories of policy-making and implementation, governance, public administration, public law, institutionalism, and organization theory as a framework of analysis.</p>
<h5>RACE &amp; eTHNIC pOLITICS</h5>
<p>Subfield Coordinator: To be determined</p>
<p>This subfield is concerned with major theories and empirical approaches the study of race and ethnicity as political identities. Drawing from works across the social sciences, we will explore a range of topics with implications for politics in the United States and countries around the world. These topics include: how identity should be conceptualized and measured; why some forms of identity are activated, mobilized, and contested; how identities are represented politically; how racial and ethnic identities intersect with other salient identities; how social diversity and civil society are interrelated; what factors affect the integration of immigrants; and which varieties of democracy enable the flourishing of plural identities. The subfield focuses on the United States and the other parts of the world, including Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. Because the study of race and ethnicity intersects with all major subfields of political science, our goal is to provide students with a fundamental understanding of the current state of knowledge as well as the intellectual resources needed to undertake their own original research.</p>
<p><strong>INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES IN POLITICAL THOUGHT</strong></p>
<p>Subfield Coordinator: To be determined</p>
<p>This course-out field option enables students of political thought to deepen their competence in political theory through work outside of the core theory curriculum, including supplemental disciplines in the social sciences and humanities.  Students satisfy this requirement by taking at least three (3) graduate-level courses (for a letter grade), which may be offered by Political Science or other departments, such as Philosophy, History, Classics, Jurisprudence and Social Policy, Rhetoric, Sociology or Comparative Literature. </p>

This seminar provides an introduction to the major debates in comparative political economy. Although the empirical focus is on the affluent democracies, many of the debates and issues analyzed have implications for other regions. The course is divided into two main parts. The first part examines leading theoretical perspectives on political economy, such as Friedman, Marx, Weber, and Polanyi. The second part of the course is more topical. It probes</span><span class="deschide"> a number of examples of economic development, crisis, and change, with an eye to assessing alternative theoretical perspectives.</span><br/>

With changes in technology, the internationalization of production and the massive increase in trans-border transactions of all kinds, it has been argued that we live and work in an era of substantively different capitalism. Were this true, it has deep implications for politics and for political economy. This graduate seminar explores the validity of this claim of a &quot;new capitalism&quot; through a variety of materials, starting with the question of whether &quot;Fordism&quot;</span><span class="deschide"> ever existed, moving on to the question of whether &quot;Post-Fordism&quot; exists and ending with a variety of ethnographic studies that show how global production chains shape culture, gender, and hieraarchy/power.</span><br/>

How has religion shaped the structure of the international system? How should IR scholars approach the role that religion plays in contemporary affairs? How does religion constrain or motivate international conflict? This seminar seeks to guide students through readings in the social sciences, from psychology and sociology to anthropology and political science, that explore the intersection of religion and international relations. We will examine</span><span class="deschide"> a variety of theoretical approaches to the topic of religion and global politics, explore religious origins of the modern state system, and analyze the influence of religion on historical and comtemporary conflicts, with a particular focus on ethnic conflict, terrorism, and peacemaking.</span><br/>

This seminar will cover the topic of international cooperation. We will begin by reviewing the positions of central IR paradigms on the possibility of international cooperation and the role of international institutions. We will talk about why states want to cooperate, which obstacles need to be overcome, and how international institutions can facilitate interstate cooperation. We examine questions concerning the design of international institutions, the extent</span><span class="deschide"> of compliance they evoke, and their effect in various areas of international cooperation. We also discuss how domestic politics affect a state’s willingness to cooperate and comply with international institutions.</span><br/>

in some form. This course, then, focuses on two themes: first, why does civil conflict occur?<br/>
What motivates individuals and groups to resort to violence? What tactics do they use? How do<br/>
they expect to succeed? Second, why do international actors intervene in civil conflict? What are<br/>

This course presents essential methodological concepts, ideas, and tools students need to know before beginning their study of the formal and quantitative methods tools used in political science research. Topics covered include functions, limits, continuity, calculus, optimization, probability and statistics, and linear algebra.

The course will study public policy in its connection with business. Policy is seen as an endogenous outcome of a game where diverse political forces try to shape public decisions to their advantage. The focus is broad, covering both theory and evidence. The aim is to analyze how a wide range of political institutions and processes affect public policy and economic performance. The ultimate goal of the course is to acquaint students with the topics at hand</span><span class="deschide">, and to consolidate their control of formal theory and quantitative techniques by discussing their application to the subject.</span><br/>

This course introduces diverse methodological tools, following the premise that all methods are strengthened if linked to qualitative analysis. Explores alternative approaches to concept formation, measurement, and causal inference, based on large- and small-N analysis and case studies. Analytic tensions that motivate the course derive from, among other sources, the pressure on case-study and small-N researchers to strive for analytic rigor</span><span class="deschide"> and generality; and the skepticism of some statisticians about quantitative inference - both descriptive and casual - in social science.</span><br/>

This course has three main objectives: to expose students to debates in the study of post-1949 Chinese politics; to consider how research on contemporary China both draws from and informs political science; and to explore characterizations of the Chinese state and state-society relations. Emphasis on questions such as: What can we learn by examining Chinese culture and institutions? Do concepts such as fragmented authoritarianism, neotraditionalism</span><span class="deschide">, state &quot;reach,&quot; civil society, and corporatism produce insights into the structure and dynamics of Chinese politics?</span><br/>

Theories and evidence concerning political conflict in advanced industrial societies. The empirical focus is on mass politics: the beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors of ordinary citizens rather than of activists or elites. The principal theoretical focus is on how changes in social structure, culture, and political institutions influence patterns of political cleavages. The analysis is largely comparative, with attention to the issue of American exceptionalism versus</span><span class="deschide"> cultural and policy convergence.</span><br/>

This course explores the implications of new strategies for coping with social problems and managing public programs. In response to growing criticism of government bureaucracy, public skepticism of expert authority, and an explosion of advocacy groups, a variety of new governance strategies have been developed. These new strategies are characterized by five broad themes: the use of markets or market mechanisms to increase efficiency; an emphasis on holding public agencies</span><span class="deschide"> accountable and making them more transparent; the development of coordinating networks to link public agencies with each other and with stakeholders; the extensive involvement of non-state organizations in all aspects of governing; and renewed attention to the civic role of individuals and communities. The course investigates the extent to which these new strategies succeed in making the governance process more efficient, accountable, effective, representative, and civic.</span><br/>

This course is intended for all new graduate student instructors (GSI) in the Department of Political Science, and is meant to be taken simultaneously with the first semester of teaching as a GSI. The course functions as a participatory workshop. Although the course is intended for first-time GSIs, it is not a course in &quot;how to be a GSI,&quot; but rather, how to be an effective political science teacher, now and at later steps in professional</span><span class="deschide"> careers. Workshop time will be divided among presentations by the instructor, discussion of required readings, and discussion of weekly assignments in relation to challenges encountered by GSIs in the course of their teaching.</span><br/>

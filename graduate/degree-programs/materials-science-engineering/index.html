				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p class="Normal1">The Department of Materials Science and Engineering offers three graduate degree programs: the Master of Engineering (MEng), 5th Year Bachelor of Science and Master of Science (BS/MS), and the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD).</p>
<h3 class="Normal1">Master of Engineering (MEng)</h3>
<p class="Normal1">In collaboration with other departments in the College of Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering is offering a professional master’s degree. The accelerated program is designed to develop professional engineering leaders in materials science and engineering who are seeking knowledge and leadership experience in MSE.</p>
<p class="Normal1">Prospective students will be engineers, typically with industrial experience, who aspire to substantially advance in their careers and ultimately to lead large, complex organizations, both in the public and private sectors.</p>
<p class="Normal1">You may choose to apply to either the full-time one-year program or part-time program for working professionals. You will be asked to choose which option you will be considered for during the application process. Both options employ the same standards and criteria for admissions.</p>
<h3 class="Normal1">5th Year Bachelor of Science and Master of Science (BS/MS)</h3>
<p class="Normal1">The Department of Materials Science and Engineering offers a five-year combined BS/MS program to our undergraduate student cohort. In this program, the existing four-year undergraduate program (BS) will be augmented with a fifth year of graduate study that provides a professionally-oriented component, preparing students for careers in engineering or engineering management within the business, government, and industrial sectors. This five-year program emphasizes interdisciplinary study through an independent project coupled to coursework.</p>
<h3 class="Normal1"><span>Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</span></h3>
<p class="Normal1">Students pursuing the PhD may also declare a designated emphasis (DE) in one of the following programs: Communication, Computation, and Statistics; Computational and Genomic Biology; Computational Science and Engineering; Energy Science and Technology; or Nanoscale Science and Engineering.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://www.mse.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="admissionstext"></a><h2>Admissions</h2><h3>Admission to the University</h3>
 <h4>Minimum Requirements for Admission</h4> <p>The following minimum requirements apply to all graduate programs and will be verified by the Graduate Division:</p> <ol> 	<li>A bachelor’s degree or recognized equivalent from an accredited institution;</li> 	<li>A grade point average of B or better (3.0);</li> 	<li>If the applicant has completed a basic degree from a country or political entity (e.g., Quebec) where English is not the official language, adequate proficiency in English to do graduate work, as evidenced by a TOEFL score of at least 90 on the iBT test, 570 on the paper-and-pencil test, or an IELTS Band score of at least 7 on a 9-point scale (note that individual programs may set higher levels for any of these); and</li> 	<li>Sufficient undergraduate training to do graduate work in the given field.</li> </ol> <h4>Applicants Who Already Hold a Graduate Degree</h4> <p>The Graduate Council views academic degrees not as vocational training certificates, but as evidence of broad training in research methods, independent study, and articulation of learning. Therefore, applicants who already have academic graduate degrees should be able to pursue new subject matter at an advanced level without the need to enroll in a related or similar graduate program.</p> <p>Programs may consider students for an additional academic master’s or professional master’s degree only if the additional degree is in a distinctly different field.</p> <p>Applicants admitted to a doctoral program that requires a master’s degree to be earned at Berkeley as a prerequisite (even though the applicant already has a master’s degree from another institution in the same or a closely allied field of study) will be permitted to undertake the second master’s degree, despite the overlap in field.</p> <p>The Graduate Division will admit students for a second doctoral degree only if they meet the following guidelines:</p> <ol> 	<li>Applicants with doctoral degrees may be admitted for an additional doctoral degree only if that degree program is in a general area of knowledge distinctly different from the field in which they earned their original degree. For example, a physics PhD could be admitted to a doctoral degree program in music or history; however, a student with a doctoral degree in mathematics would not be permitted to add a PhD in statistics.</li> 	<li>Applicants who hold the PhD degree may be admitted to a professional doctorate or professional master’s degree program if there is no duplication of training involved.</li> </ol> <p>Applicants may apply only to one single degree program or one concurrent degree program per admission cycle.</p> <h4>Required Documents for Applications</h4> <ol> 	<li><strong>Transcripts: </strong>Applicants may upload <em>unofficial </em>transcripts with your application for the departmental initial review. Unofficial transcripts must contain specific information including the name of the applicant, name of the school, all courses, grades, units, &amp; degree conferral (if applicable). </li> 	<li><strong>Letters of recommendation:</strong> Applicants may request online letters of recommendation through the online application system. Hard copies of recommendation letters must be sent directly to the program, by the recommender, not the Graduate Admissions.</li> 	<li> 	<p><strong><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">Evidence of English language proficiency:</span> </strong>All applicants who have completed a basic degree from a country or political entity in which the official language is not English are required to submit official evidence of English language proficiency. This applies to institutions from Bangladesh, Burma, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Latin America, the Middle East, the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, most European countries, and Quebec (Canada). However, applicants who, at the time of application, have already completed at least one year of full-time academic course work with grades of B or better at a US university may submit an official transcript from the US university to fulfill this requirement. The following courses will not fulfill this requirement:</p> 	<ul> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses in English as a Second Language,</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses conducted in a language other than English,</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses that will be completed after the application is submitted, and</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses of a non-academic nature.</span></p> 		</li> 	</ul> 	</li> </ol> <p style="margin-left:30pt"><span><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">Applicants who have previously applied to Berkeley must also submit new test scores that meet the current minimum requirement from one of the standardized tests. Official TOEFL score reports must be sent directly from Educational Test Services (ETS). The institution code for Berkeley is 4833 for Graduate Organizations. Official IELTS score reports must be sent electronically from the testing center to University of California, Berkeley, Graduate Division, Sproul Hall, Rm 318 MC 5900, Berkeley, CA 94720. TOEFL and IELTS score reports are only valid for two years prior to beginning the graduate program at UC Berkeley. </span></span>Note: score reports can not expire before the month of June.</p> <div> </div> <h4>Where to Apply</h4> <p>Visit the Berkeley Graduate Division <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply/" target="_blank">application page</a>. </p>
<h3>Admission to the Program</h3>
<p>Admission decisions are based on a combination of factors, including academic degrees and records, the statement of purpose, letters of recommendation, test scores, and relevant work experience. The MSE department also considers the appropriateness of your goals to the degree program in which you are interested and to the research interests of the program’s faculty.</p>
<p class="Normal1">To be considered for graduate admissions in MSE you need:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A bachelor’s degree or recognized equivalent (must be conferred prior to enrollment into our program) from an accredited institution in engineering, physics or chemistry is required. We do not accept students without these types of degrees.</li>
	<li>Sufficient undergraduate training to do graduate work in your chosen field.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade-point average (GPA) of 3.0 (B). International students should be in the top 5% of their class.</li>
	<li>We require three letters of recommendation submitted online.</li>
	<li>A general Graduate Record Exam (GRE) General Test score (85th percentile or higher is desirable) in the Verbal/Analytical/Quantitative sections.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Preliminary Exams</h4>
<p>In this oral exam students must demonstrate:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Mastery of the essential components of a Materials Science and Engineering education at a level commensurate with the completion of an undergraduate MSE degree at Berkeley, and</li>
	<li>Their ability to use this knowledge in ongoing research.</li>
</ol>
<p>The examination is divided into six topics germane to ceramic, metallic, semiconducting, and soft materials, including their appropriate composites. Six faculty examiners are appointed each semester by the department chair, one examiner per topic, who conduct the exam in individual oral interviews lasting approximately 20 minutes. The examination topics are:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Thermodynamics;</li>
	<li>Phase Transformations;</li>
	<li>Bonding, Crystallography, and Crystal Defects; </li>
	<li>Materials Characterization;</li>
	<li>Mechanical Properties; and</li>
	<li>Electronic Properties.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Qualifying Examination</h4>
<p>The PhD qualifying exam tests the student's ability to identify a significant problem, to assemble the background information needed to grasp it in the context of the field, and to construct a technical approach that provides a plausible path to its solution. At the same time, the qualifying exam will test the student's knowledge of the subject matter within the broad research field and his or her major field.</p>
<p>The examination consists of two parts, namely, a written proposal, and the oral examination:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Written Proposal. The proposal describes the intended PhD research. At least two weeks before the examination date the student must submit a written research proposal to his/her committee. The proposal must include a one-page abstract and be roughly five to ten pages long. It must contain a concise statement of the research problem and its significance, a discussion of the technical background, the technical approach (experimental and/or theoretical), the anticipated results, and a bibliography. This written proposal is to be prepared by the student without direct collaboration or assistance from the faculty.</li>
	<li>The Examination. The student should prepare a 30-minute oral presentation of the research proposal(s). The committee will question the student on the material presented orally, the material contained in the written proposal, and the general technical background to the research area. The student should be familiar with the relevant literature. The student must also defend the significance of the research problem and the viability of the technical approach. The second part of the examination consists of questions in the major and minor fields.</li>
</ol>

<h4><strong>Biomaterials</strong></h4>
<p>Traditionally, biomaterials encompass synthetic alternatives to the native materials found in our body. A central limitation in the performance of traditional materials used in medical device, biotechnological, and pharmaceutical industries is that they lack the ability to integrate with biological systems through either a molecular or cellular pathway, which has relegated biomaterials to a passive role dictated by the constituents of a particular environment, leading to unfavorable outcomes and device failure. The design and synthesis of materials that circumvent their passive behavior in complex mammalian cells is the focus of the work conducted within the MSE Department at Berkeley.</p>
<p>Biomimetic Surface Engineering:<br/>
Surface modification of medical implants to control wound healing and tissue regeneration.</p>
<p>Biologically-defined Microdevices:<br/>
Design and fabrication of surfaces, using advanced pattern techniques, to facilitate cell and molecular-based microarrays.</p>

<h4><strong>Computational Materials </strong></h4>
<p>Computational methods are increasingly important in all areas of science and engineering, Computational Materials Science capitalizes on advancements in these fields, which include high throughput approaches and machine learning. Materials Science and Engineering applications range from the theoretical prediction of the electronic and structural properties of materials to chemical kinetics and equilibria or modeling the chemical kinetics and equilibria in a materials processing operation, to now predicting the existence of new materials and their properties. These advances in computational techniques have yielded remarkable insight into materials behaviors, particularly at the nanoscale. Under favorable circumstances, it is now possible to predict in exquisite detail many properties of materials at the nanoscale (one nanometer = 1 billionth of a meter) by merely solving Schrodinger’s famous equation. These advancements have positioned researchers within the department to be very active in developing data for the Materials Project <a href="https://materialsproject.org/">https://materialsproject.org</a>, an effort to construct a database of all computable properties for all known materials.</p>

This course is intended to give students the opportunity to expand their knowledge of topics related to biomedical materials selection and design. Structure-property relationships of biomedical materials and their interaction with biological systems will be addressed. Applications of the concepts developed include blood-materials compatibility, biomimetic materials, hard and soft tissue-materials interactions, drug delivery, tissue engineering</span><span class="deschide">, and biotechnology.</span><br/>

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> The course is separated into four parts spanning the principles of synthetic materials and surfaces, principles of biological materials, biological performance of materials and devices, and state-of-the-art materials design. Students are required to attend class and master the material therein. In addition, readings from the clinical, life and materials science literature are assigned. Students are encouraged to seek out additional reference material to complement the readings assigned. A mid-term examination is given on basic principles (parts 1 and 2 of the outline). A comprehensive final examination is given as well. <br/>The purpose of this course is to introduce students to problems associated with the selection and function of biomaterials. Through class lectures and readings in both the physical and life science literature, students will gain broad knowledge of the criteria used to select biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance. Materials used in devices for medicine, dentistry, tissue engineering, drug delivery, and the biotechnology industry will be addressed.<br/>
<br/>This course also has a significant design component (~35%). Students will form small teams (five or less) and undertake a semester-long design project related to the subject matter of the course. The project includes the preparation of a paper and a 20 minute oral presentation critically analyzing a current material-tissue or material-solution problem. Students will be expected to design improvements to materials and devices to overcome the problems identified in class with existing materials.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Work independently and function on a team, and develop solid communication skills (oral, graphic &amp; written) through the class design project.<br/>
•<br/>
Develop an understanding of the social, safety and medical consequences of biomaterial use and regulatory issues associated with the selection of biomaterials in the context of the silicone breast implant controversy and subsequent biomaterials crisis.<br/>
•<br/>
Design experiments and analyze data from the literature in the context of the class design project.<br/>
<br/>
•<br/>
Understanding of the origin of surface forces and interfacial free energy, and how they contribute to the development of the biomaterial interface and ultimately biomaterial performance.<br/>
•<br/>
Apply math, science &amp; engineering principles to the understanding of soft materials, surface chemistry, DLVO theory, protein adsorption kinetics, viscoelasticity, mass diffusion, and molecular (i.e., drug) delivery kinetics.<br/>
•<br/>
Apply core concepts in materials science to solve engineering problems related to the selection biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance.<br/></p></div>

<![CDATA[
<p class="Normal1">The Applied Science and Technology graduate group is administered by the College of Engineering. The program is aimed at students with research interests that are truly interdisciplinary. Faculty members associated with the program are drawn from several departments within the College of Engineering, as well as from the departments of Physics, Chemistry, Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Statistics, and Mathematics. Topics of interest include the properties and applications of nanostructures; thin-film and interface science; microelectromechanical systems (MEMS); short-wavelength coherent radiation; X-ray micro-imaging for the life and physical sciences; plasma physics and plasma-assisted materials processing; laser-induced chemical processes; laser probing of complex reacting systems; ultrafast phenomena; particle accelerators; nonlinear dynamics; chaotic systems; numerical methods; and computational fluid mechanics and reacting flows, etc.</p>
<p>Within the program students design their own course of study in consultation with their advisors, choosing from the vast array of technical offerings throughout the campus. The chosen coursework should prepare the student for interdisciplinary research. Students in the PhD program may pursue a Designated Emphasis (DE) such as the DE in Nanoscale Science and Engineering (DE NSE); Energy, Science, and Technology (DE EST); and Computational Science and Engineering (DE CSE).</p>
<p>Graduate research in the AS&amp;T Program benefits from state-of-the-art experimental facilities on the Berkeley campus and at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Among these facilities is the National Center for Electron Microscopy, which has the world's highest resolution high-voltage microscope; a microfabrication lab for student work involving lithography; MEMS ion-implantation and thin-film deposition; an integrated sensors laboratory, femtosecond laser laboratories; optical, electrical, and magnetic resonance spectroscopies; short-wavelength laser and Xray research laboratories; an unparalleled variety of material, chemical, and surface science analytic equipment; and a soft X-ray synchrotron dedicated to materials, chemical, and biological research using high-brightness and partially coherent X-rays. The interdisciplinary collaborative nature of the AS&amp;T Program provides ample opportunity to develop new research directions by making the best use possible of these facilities and the other research instrumentation available to AS&amp;T faculty.</p>

<h3 class="Normal1">Admission to the University</h3>
 <h4>Minimum Requirements for Admission</h4> <p>The following minimum requirements apply to all graduate programs and will be verified by the Graduate Division:</p> <ol> 	<li>A bachelor’s degree or recognized equivalent from an accredited institution;</li> 	<li>A grade point average of B or better (3.0);</li> 	<li>If the applicant has completed a basic degree from a country or political entity (e.g., Quebec) where English is not the official language, adequate proficiency in English to do graduate work, as evidenced by a TOEFL score of at least 90 on the iBT test, 570 on the paper-and-pencil test, or an IELTS Band score of at least 7 on a 9-point scale (note that individual programs may set higher levels for any of these); and</li> 	<li>Sufficient undergraduate training to do graduate work in the given field.</li> </ol> <h4>Applicants Who Already Hold a Graduate Degree</h4> <p>The Graduate Council views academic degrees not as vocational training certificates, but as evidence of broad training in research methods, independent study, and articulation of learning. Therefore, applicants who already have academic graduate degrees should be able to pursue new subject matter at an advanced level without the need to enroll in a related or similar graduate program.</p> <p>Programs may consider students for an additional academic master’s or professional master’s degree only if the additional degree is in a distinctly different field.</p> <p>Applicants admitted to a doctoral program that requires a master’s degree to be earned at Berkeley as a prerequisite (even though the applicant already has a master’s degree from another institution in the same or a closely allied field of study) will be permitted to undertake the second master’s degree, despite the overlap in field.</p> <p>The Graduate Division will admit students for a second doctoral degree only if they meet the following guidelines:</p> <ol> 	<li>Applicants with doctoral degrees may be admitted for an additional doctoral degree only if that degree program is in a general area of knowledge distinctly different from the field in which they earned their original degree. For example, a physics PhD could be admitted to a doctoral degree program in music or history; however, a student with a doctoral degree in mathematics would not be permitted to add a PhD in statistics.</li> 	<li>Applicants who hold the PhD degree may be admitted to a professional doctorate or professional master’s degree program if there is no duplication of training involved.</li> </ol> <p>Applicants may apply only to one single degree program or one concurrent degree program per admission cycle.</p> <h4>Required Documents for Applications</h4> <ol> 	<li><strong>Transcripts: </strong>Applicants may upload <em>unofficial </em>transcripts with your application for the departmental initial review. Unofficial transcripts must contain specific information including the name of the applicant, name of the school, all courses, grades, units, &amp; degree conferral (if applicable). </li> 	<li><strong>Letters of recommendation:</strong> Applicants may request online letters of recommendation through the online application system. Hard copies of recommendation letters must be sent directly to the program, by the recommender, not the Graduate Admissions.</li> 	<li> 	<p><strong><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">Evidence of English language proficiency:</span> </strong>All applicants who have completed a basic degree from a country or political entity in which the official language is not English are required to submit official evidence of English language proficiency. This applies to institutions from Bangladesh, Burma, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Latin America, the Middle East, the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, most European countries, and Quebec (Canada). However, applicants who, at the time of application, have already completed at least one year of full-time academic course work with grades of B or better at a US university may submit an official transcript from the US university to fulfill this requirement. The following courses will not fulfill this requirement:</p> 	<ul> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses in English as a Second Language,</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses conducted in a language other than English,</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses that will be completed after the application is submitted, and</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses of a non-academic nature.</span></p> 		</li> 	</ul> 	</li> </ol> <p style="margin-left:30pt"><span><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">Applicants who have previously applied to Berkeley must also submit new test scores that meet the current minimum requirement from one of the standardized tests. Official TOEFL score reports must be sent directly from Educational Test Services (ETS). The institution code for Berkeley is 4833 for Graduate Organizations. Official IELTS score reports must be sent electronically from the testing center to University of California, Berkeley, Graduate Division, Sproul Hall, Rm 318 MC 5900, Berkeley, CA 94720. TOEFL and IELTS score reports are only valid for two years prior to beginning the graduate program at UC Berkeley. </span></span>Note: score reports can not expire before the month of June.</p> <div> </div> <h4>Where to Apply</h4> <p>Visit the Berkeley Graduate Division <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply/" target="_blank">application page</a>. </p>

<div class="page-title pad group">
<h3>Course Requirements</h3>
<p>A minimum of 32 semester units of letter-graded coursework is required, exclusive of seminars and research. Of these 32 units, at least 24 units must be graduate level (200 series) courses, and the remaining 8 units may be upper division or graduate level courses. The student’s program is developed in consultation with the faculty research advisor and faculty academic advisor to suit his/her individual needs. The interdisciplinary nature of the group makes it particularly important that the student discuss all coursework with the faculty research advisor, who is most familiar with the skills and knowledge necessary to complete the dissertation. The student is required to complete at least 18 semester units relating to the student’s major research field. In addition, a minor must be established by taking 8 semester units in the chosen minor emphasis area with appropriate technical content to prepare the student for the Qualifying examination and the dissertation. </p>
<h4>Major and Minor Area Unit Requirements</h4>
<p>Of the 32 required units, 26 are taken in establishing the major area and minor areas, leaving 6 discretionary units.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>18 major area units: </strong>This will be specific to the students primary research concentration. Units must be graduate and letter graded.</li>
	<li><strong>8 minor area units:</strong> Student will select emphasis area with appropriate technical content to prepare the student for the Qualifying examination and the dissertation. Units can be a combination of graduate and upper division courses and must be letter-graded.</li>
	<li><strong>6 discretionary units:</strong> technical graduate or upper division letter graded units. </li>
</ul>
<div> </div>
<div><em>**Of these 32 units, at least 24 units must be graduate level (200 series) courses, and the remaining 8 units may be upper division or graduate level courses.  Faculty research advisor and faculty academic advisor approval required for all units taken.<em>*</em>*</em></div>
<h3>Preliminary Exam</h3>
</div>
<div class="pad group">
<div class="entry themeform">
<p><span id="parent-fieldname-description">All students who enter the PhD program must take a one and a half hour oral AS&amp;T preliminary examination based upon basic courses in their field of expertise. The exam must be taken no later than the second semester of the first academic year within the program (typically in late spring semester). Students who fail to pass the exam are allowed one more attempt, to be taken no later than the end of their third semester. A selection of courses to be covered in each of the examination areas will be established, and an oral examination will be arranged.</span></p>
<h3><span>Qualifying Exam</span></h3>
<p>By the requirements of the Graduate Division, students enrolled in the PhD program must pass an oral qualifying examination in subjects appropriate to their approved areas of study. The examination will test the student’s broad knowledge of areas related to his or her chosen areas of emphasis, as well as the depth of understanding in the areas in which the student anticipates undertaking research. The oral qualifying examination can be scheduled at any time mutually agreeable to the student and his or her graduate advisor, but in no case later than the third year after passing the AS&amp;T preliminary examination. Students are urged to check the general University requirements for this examination. </p>
<h3>Dissertation</h3>
<p>The dissertation, the product of independent investigation under faculty supervision, is the final requirement for the doctoral program. The student’s research adviser is the chair of the dissertation committee, who is joined by two (2) other Academic Senate members. The dissertation committee must be approved by both the head graduate advisor and the Dean of the Graduate Division.</p>

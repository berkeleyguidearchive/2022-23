				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p class="Body1">The mission of the Department of City and Regional Planning at UC Berkeley is to improve equity, the economy and the environment in neighborhoods, communities, cities, and metropolitan regions by creating knowledge and engagement through our teaching, research, and service. We aim to design and create cities, infrastructure, and public services that are sustainable, affordable, enjoyable, and accessible to all.</p>
<p class="Body1">Wisely and successfully intervening in the public realm, whether locally, nationally, or globally, is a challenge. Our urban future is complex and rapidly changing. Resource scarcity and conflict, technological innovation, retrofitting of existing built environments, and social empowerment will alter the ways in which planning has conventionally been carried out.</p>
<p class="Body1">We believe the planning academy has a special responsibility to always address social justice, equity, and ethics; to teach and research means of public participation, collective decision making, and advocacy; and to focus on reforming institutions, urban governance, policy, and planning practices to make these goals possible.</p>
<h3 class="Normal1">Master of City Planning (M.C.P.) </h3>
<p class="Normal1">The two-year Master of City Planning (M.C.P.) program comprises a solid core of knowledge in the field of city and regional planning, including history and theory, planning skills and methods, planning law,  and urban economics. The program offers the opportunity to specialize in one to two of the four concentration areas: Environmental Planning and Healthy Cities (EPHC); Housing, Community and Economic Development (HCED); Transportation Policy and Planning; and Urban Design.</p>
<h4>Accreditation</h4>
<p>The M.C.P. program at UC Berkeley is one of the oldest accredited planning programs in the country. The Planning Accreditation Board (PAB) last reviewed the M.C.P. program in Fall 2016, and in Spring 2017 issued reaccreditation for five years. For more information about PAB, please visit <a href="http://www.planningaccreditationboard.org/" target="_blank">http://www.planningaccreditationboard.org/</a>.</p>
<h4>Science, Technology, Engineering or Mathematics (STEM) Designated Degree Program </h4>
<p>The M.C.P. degree is an approved field of study within the U.S. government’s official STEM fields list. For international students, practical work experience in your field of study, typically after completion of a degree for a maximum of 36 months (12 months of “regular” OPT with a 24-month extension possible). For further details regarding <a href="https://internationaloffice.berkeley.edu/students/employment/stemopt" target="_blank">STEM extensions</a>, contact the <a href="https://internationaloffice.berkeley.edu/contact-us" target="_blank">Berkeley International Office (BIO)</a>.</p>
<h3 class="Normal1">Ph.D. in City and Regional Planning</h3>
<p class="Preformatted">The Ph.D. in City and Regional Planning at the University of California, Berkeley provides training in urban and planning theory, advanced research, and the practice of planning. Established in 1968, the program has granted more than 170 doctorates. Alumni of the program have established national and international reputations as planning educators, social science researchers and theorists, policymakers and practitioners. Today the program is served by nearly 20 City and Regional Planning faculty with expertise in community and economic development, transportation planning, urban design, international development, environmental planning, and global urbanism. With close ties to numerous research centers and initiatives, the program encourages its students to develop specializations within the field of urban studies and planning and to expand their intellectual horizons through training in the related fields of architecture, landscape architecture and environmental planning, civil engineering, anthropology, geography, sociology, public policy, public health, and political science.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/city-regional-planning/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="admissionstext"></a><h2>Admissions</h2><h3 class="Normal1">Admission to the University</h3>
 <h4>Minimum Requirements for Admission</h4> <p>The following minimum requirements apply to all graduate programs and will be verified by the Graduate Division:</p> <ol> 	<li>A bachelor’s degree or recognized equivalent from an accredited institution;</li> 	<li>A grade point average of B or better (3.0);</li> 	<li>If the applicant has completed a basic degree from a country or political entity (e.g., Quebec) where English is not the official language, adequate proficiency in English to do graduate work, as evidenced by a TOEFL score of at least 90 on the iBT test, 570 on the paper-and-pencil test, or an IELTS Band score of at least 7 on a 9-point scale (note that individual programs may set higher levels for any of these); and</li> 	<li>Sufficient undergraduate training to do graduate work in the given field.</li> </ol> <h4>Applicants Who Already Hold a Graduate Degree</h4> <p>The Graduate Council views academic degrees not as vocational training certificates, but as evidence of broad training in research methods, independent study, and articulation of learning. Therefore, applicants who already have academic graduate degrees should be able to pursue new subject matter at an advanced level without the need to enroll in a related or similar graduate program.</p> <p>Programs may consider students for an additional academic master’s or professional master’s degree only if the additional degree is in a distinctly different field.</p> <p>Applicants admitted to a doctoral program that requires a master’s degree to be earned at Berkeley as a prerequisite (even though the applicant already has a master’s degree from another institution in the same or a closely allied field of study) will be permitted to undertake the second master’s degree, despite the overlap in field.</p> <p>The Graduate Division will admit students for a second doctoral degree only if they meet the following guidelines:</p> <ol> 	<li>Applicants with doctoral degrees may be admitted for an additional doctoral degree only if that degree program is in a general area of knowledge distinctly different from the field in which they earned their original degree. For example, a physics PhD could be admitted to a doctoral degree program in music or history; however, a student with a doctoral degree in mathematics would not be permitted to add a PhD in statistics.</li> 	<li>Applicants who hold the PhD degree may be admitted to a professional doctorate or professional master’s degree program if there is no duplication of training involved.</li> </ol> <p>Applicants may apply only to one single degree program or one concurrent degree program per admission cycle.</p> <h4>Required Documents for Applications</h4> <ol> 	<li><strong>Transcripts: </strong>Applicants may upload <em>unofficial </em>transcripts with your application for the departmental initial review. Unofficial transcripts must contain specific information including the name of the applicant, name of the school, all courses, grades, units, &amp; degree conferral (if applicable). </li> 	<li><strong>Letters of recommendation:</strong> Applicants may request online letters of recommendation through the online application system. Hard copies of recommendation letters must be sent directly to the program, by the recommender, not the Graduate Admissions.</li> 	<li> 	<p><strong><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">Evidence of English language proficiency:</span> </strong>All applicants who have completed a basic degree from a country or political entity in which the official language is not English are required to submit official evidence of English language proficiency. This applies to institutions from Bangladesh, Burma, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Latin America, the Middle East, the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, most European countries, and Quebec (Canada). However, applicants who, at the time of application, have already completed at least one year of full-time academic course work with grades of B or better at a US university may submit an official transcript from the US university to fulfill this requirement. The following courses will not fulfill this requirement:</p> 	<ul> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses in English as a Second Language,</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses conducted in a language other than English,</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses that will be completed after the application is submitted, and</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses of a non-academic nature.</span></p> 		</li> 	</ul> 	</li> </ol> <p style="margin-left:30pt"><span><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">Applicants who have previously applied to Berkeley must also submit new test scores that meet the current minimum requirement from one of the standardized tests. Official TOEFL score reports must be sent directly from Educational Test Services (ETS). The institution code for Berkeley is 4833 for Graduate Organizations. Official IELTS score reports must be sent electronically from the testing center to University of California, Berkeley, Graduate Division, Sproul Hall, Rm 318 MC 5900, Berkeley, CA 94720. TOEFL and IELTS score reports are only valid for two years prior to beginning the graduate program at UC Berkeley. </span></span>Note: score reports can not expire before the month of June.</p> <div> </div> <h4>Where to Apply</h4> <p>Visit the Berkeley Graduate Division <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply/" target="_blank">application page</a>. </p>
<h3 class="Normal1">Admission to the Ph.D. in City and Regional Planning Program  </h3>
<p>The principal admission requirements to the doctoral program in City and Regional Planning are overall excellence in past academic work and research, demonstrated creativity and intellectual leadership in professional activity, and the strong promise of sustained intellectual achievement, originality, and scholarship. The emphasis in the doctoral program is upon scholarship and research. At the same time, because the doctorate is offered in the context of a professional school, doctoral students are challenged to undertake applied research relevant to city and regional planning and policy problems. If you do not want to teach in planning or a related field, or to do advanced research, please reconsider applying to this program. Most doctoral students enter the program with a master's degree in planning or a related field. The Master of City Planning is regarded as a terminal professional degree, and is not comparable to mid-study Master of Arts or Master of Science degrees offered in anticipation of the doctorate.</p>
<p>Admission to the doctoral program is very competitive. Only six to eight students are admitted each year, sometimes from a pool of as many as 80 applicants. All applicants to the doctoral program (even those required to take an English-language competency exam—TOEFL, TOEFL CBT, iBT TOEFL, or IELTS) must take the Graduate Record Examination; tests should be taken before December to ensure timely receipt of scores. Applicants must also secure at least three letters of recommendation that can explicitly evaluate their intellectual capability and past research and academic work.</p>

<h3>Admission to the Master of City Planning (M.C.P.) Program</h3>
<p>The M.C.P. Program Committee seeks applicants with keen interests in social justice, equity and ethics; innovative means of public participation, collective decision making, and advocacy; and ways to reform institutions, urban governance, policy and planning practices. We look for applicants with intellectual curiosity, preparation, maturity, and desire to delve into an intense program of study in one of the top-rated professional planning programs in the country. We look at what you have undertaken as an undergraduate, both inside and outside the classroom, and whether you have focused your efforts around planning or related field. Admitted students are drawn from a broad range of undergraduate majors, including social sciences, environmental majors, engineering, geography, economics, and so on. M.C.P. students possess broad perspectives on society and culture, while focusing and grounding their studies in a particular planning concentration. The M.C.P. Program Committee gives particular weight to letters of recommendation, the Statement of Purpose (SOP) and the Personal History Statement (PHS). The two statements, as a unit, should clearly present why you are interested in a planning career, your goals and the reasons for them, and what you hope to achieve in a Berkeley professional program.</p>

<h3>Field Requirements</h3>
<p>In addition to general training in planning and urban theory and in research methods, the PhD program in DCRP encourages students to gain depth of knowledge in at least two fields of their choosing. Completed under the supervision of a faculty committee usually chaired by the student’s primary adviser, the inside field statement and examination is a self-defined specialization of study within city and regional planning. Completed under the supervision of an outside field advisor (a faculty member outside the department), the outside field is a set of courses and assignments that build expertise in an area of study related to city and regional planning.</p>
<h4>Inside Field</h4>
<p>The inside field is a self-defined specialization of study within city and regional planning. Such a specialization can be a sub-field of city and regional planning (e.g. community development, regional planning, housing, international development, urban design, transportation planning, land use, environmental planning) or it can be a unique field defined by the student in consultation with faculty advisers. Note that the intent of the inside field is not to make a theoretical contribution to the field but instead to demonstrate mastery of existing paradigms and debates within a field of inquiry.</p>
<p>Mastery is defined as:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Demonstrating knowledge of key foundational texts within the inside field subject of study;</li>
	<li>Understanding how the history of thought within that area has developed (including epistemologies and methodologies, critiques and points of contention), and</li>
	<li>Engaging analytically with the current state of research and recent work in the field.</li>
</ol>
<p>To undertake the inside field requirement, each student must constitute an inside field committee of three Academic Senate faculty from the department. This committee is usually chaired by the student’s primary adviser.</p>
<h5>Inside Field Statement</h5>
<p>Working closely with their inside field committee, the student must prepare an inside field statement, which explains the scope of the field and provides a bibliography encompassing the key conceptual frameworks that make up this field. Typically an inside field statement is 10-20 double-spaced pages in length with a bibliography of at least 50-60 academic books and peer-reviewed journal articles. Note that the length and scope of the inside field will vary depending on the expectations of the inside field committee and the nature of the inside field topic. What is important for doctoral students to keep in mind is that the inside field statement is not the Inside field examination but rather an analytical exercise meant to set the stage for the examination. With this in mind, the inside field statement should generate the analytic categories and concepts that will then be used by the inside field committee to structure the inside field examination.</p>
<h5>Inside Field Examination</h5>
<p>Once the statement has been approved by the inside field committee, the student may proceed to the inside field examination, a three-day take-home written examination. Students with accommodations approved by the Disabled Students’ Program (DSP) may be granted additional time for the examination.</p>
<p>In DCRP, the inside field examination consists of three sections related to the categories and concepts outlined in the inside field statement. Each section contains 2-3 questions and students answer one question in each section, with a limit of 10 double-spaced pages per answer. All sections of the examination are graded by all members of the inside field committee.</p>
<p>The examination is administered by DCRP’s student affairs officer. Students are responsible for arranging the examination date and coordinating the logistics of the examination with the student affairs officer. Students with disabilities should consult with the student affairs officer for campus-approved accommodations. A copy of the inside field statement must be filed with the student affairs officer; this will also be archived in the Environmental Design Library.</p>
<p>Students must successfully complete the inside field requirement before proceeding to the oral qualifying examination. DCRP requires a six-week minimum gap between the inside field examination and the oral qualifying examination, to allow for adequate time for faculty feedback and revision. Grading of the examination is coordinated by the chair of the inside field committee. Possible grades include: distinction, pass, and fail. If one of the three essays receives a failing grade, the student will be asked to rewrite this essay within a time period determined by the committee. If two or more essays receive a failing grade, the committee will ask the student to retake the entire examination. Students who fail the examination twice will be asked to withdraw from the PhD program.</p>
<h5>Outside Field</h5>
<p>The outside field is a set of courses and assignments meant to build expertise in an area of study related to city and regional planning. Such a specialization can be a discipline relevant to planning (e.g. geography, anthropology, public health, economics, sociology) or it can be a unique field defined by the student in consultation with the outside field adviser. Note that the intent of the outside field is not to make a theoretical contribution to the field but instead to demonstrate mastery of existing paradigms and debates. Students must successfully complete the outside field requirement before proceeding to the oral qualifying examination.</p>
<p>To undertake the outside field requirement, a student must select an outside field adviser, a member of the Academic Senate faculty in a department other than city and regional planning. The outside field adviser usually serves as the outside member of the oral qualifying examination committee and as the outside member of the dissertation committee. The content of the outside field is determined by the outside field adviser but must include at least two letter-graded courses supplemented by an additional reading list and writing assignments. These specific requirements must be listed by the outside field adviser on a form, which is filed with DCRP’s Students Affairs Office and which serves as a declaration of the outside field. On successful completion of the outside field, the adviser signs a second form, which is also filed with the Student Affairs Office.</p>
<h3>Oral Qualifying Examination</h3>
<p>The oral qualifying examination marks advancement to candidacy. The examination is governed by policies set by the Graduate Division. In addition, DCRP has requirements for the examination.</p>
<h4>Eligibility to take the Oral Qualifying Examination</h4>
<p> To be eligible to take the exam, a student must:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Be registered and enrolled for the semester in which the exam is taken or, if it is taken during the winter or summer sessions, be registered in either the preceding or the following semester;</li>
	<li>Have completed at least one semester of academic residence;</li>
	<li>Have at least a B average in all work undertaken in graduate standing;</li>
	<li>Have no more than two courses graded Incomplete;</li>
	<li>Have satisfactorily completed departmental preliminary exam requirements (Planning and Urban Theory; Research Methods; Inside and Outside Fields; preparation of dissertation prospectus).</li>
</ol>
<h4>Applying to take the Qualifying Examination</h4>
<p>Graduate Division approval is required to take the oral qualifying examination. In order to allow Graduate Division sufficient time to review and approve the application, students must apply to take the qualifying examination and file the necessary paperwork with DCRP’s Student Affairs Office no later than one month before the examination date. The application for Qualifying Examination is part of the Higher Degree Committee eForm in CalCentral. The completed application must be received by the Graduate Division at least three weeks before the proposed examination date.</p>
<p><strong>Note that students must list on their applications at least three subject areas to be covered during the examination. These three areas are: Planning and Urban Theory, Inside Field topic, and Outside Field topic.</strong></p>
<p>Also note that in keeping with Graduate Division guidelines, DCRP’s head graduate adviser (chair of the PhD program committee) must also be certain that students who are non-native speakers possess the English skills necessary for participating in an oral exam since the qualifying examination must be conducted in English.</p>
<h4>The Oral Qualifying Examination Committee</h4>
<p>The oral qualifying exam committee in DCRP is composed of four Academic Senate faculty members (see section F4.9 of the <a href="http://www.grad.berkeley.edu/policies/ggp/ggp.pdf">Guide to Graduate Policy</a>). The chair of the qualifying examination committee must be an Academic Senate faculty from City and Regional Planning; the OQE chair cannot also serve as chair of the student’s dissertation committee. The committee must include at least one outside member, i.e., an Academic Senate faculty from a department other than City and Regional Planning. Typically three of the four OQE members will serve on the student’s dissertation committee.</p>
<h4>Scheduling the Examination</h4>
<p>Scheduling the oral qualifying examination is the responsibility of the student. Students are urged to begin the process of finding an examination date several months ahead of their preferred window of time. The OQE must be scheduled for three hours and all members of the oral qualifying examination committee must be present for the entire duration of the examination.</p>
<p>If the student’s health or personal situation makes it impossible to take the examination as scheduled, or if accommodation for a disability is necessary, the student is required to make this known before the examination so the chair can arrange for a postponement or appropriate accommodation.</p>
<h4>The Examination</h4>
<p>In DCRP, an oral qualifying examination consists of the main examination followed by a discussion of the dissertation prospectus. The examination starts with a brief biographical introduction (five minutes) provided by the student. During the main part of the examination, the student is responsible for the three areas listed on the application for the examination.<strong> </strong>In DCRP, these are Planning and Urban Theory, Inside Field Topic, and Outside Field topic. Committee members ask questions in sequence, usually with 20 minutes allocated per faculty, in an order determined by the student. If the student passes the examination, the committee reconvenes for the remainder of the time to discuss the dissertation prospectus. During this section, students present their dissertation research topic and design but their performance here does not determine whether they pass or fail the oral qualifying examination. Note that by Graduate Division guidelines, evaluation of the dissertation prospectus cannot be the primary content of the oral qualifying examination.</p>
<h4>The Dissertation Prospectus and other Examination Material</h4>
<p>As prerequisites to the oral qualifying examination, DCRP requires the following completed documents to be disseminated to all members of the oral qualifying examination committee at least two weeks prior to the date of the examination. Four hard copies of this material, organized in spiral-bound format, must be submitted to DCRP’s Student Affairs Office, by this deadline. An electronic copy must also be submitted to the Student Affairs Office. Both hard copies and electronic copies will be sent out by the Student Affairs Office to the members of the oral qualifying examination committee.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Inside Field Statement and Bibliography</li>
	<li>Inside Field Examination</li>
	<li>Outside Field List of Requirements + Reading List</li>
	<li>Dissertation Prospectus</li>
</ul>
<p>The dissertation prospectus is a statement of research design. Written under the supervision of the primary adviser, the prospectus typically lists the key research questions that guide this research project; explains the significance of these questions in relation to existing empirical and theoretical literature; presents a detailed research methodology and plan for gathering evidence; outlines strategies of data analysis and interpretation; and makes a case for the general application of anticipated research findings. A full-length dissertation prospectus is usually 20-25 double-spaced pages in length and includes a detailed bibliography.</p>
<h4>Oral Qualifying Examination Outcomes</h4>
<p>The Graduate Division policy regarding grading, reporting, and re-administering <a href="https://grad.berkeley.edu/policy/degrees-policy/#f26-qualifying-examination">oral qualifying exams</a> is as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Pass</strong>. The qualifying examination committee unanimously votes that the student passed the examination with scholarship that is at least acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong>. A total failure occurs if the qualifying examination committee votes unanimously that the student failed the entire examination. The committee either: </p>
<ol>
	<li>Recommends that the student take a second and final examination on all examination topics; or</li>
	<li>Does not recommend reexamination, the consequence of which will be the student’s dismissal from the program.</li>
</ol>
<p>If a second and final examination is recommended, the following procedures apply:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The committee must submit its “Report to the Graduate Division on the Qualifying Examination” with its recommendation;</li>
	<li>Committee membership for the student’s retake must be the same as for the first exam;</li>
	<li>The student may not retake the exam until three months after the first exam unless an exception is approved by the Graduate Division; and</li>
	<li>A third examination is not permitted. If the committee wishes to suggest preparation for the second examination through additional course work or special tutoring, this must be communicated to the student in writing with a copy to the Graduate Division.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the committee does not recommend a reexamination, a written explanation by the committee chair must accompany the completed “Report to the Graduate Division on the Qualifying Examination” and sent to the Graduate Division. If the Graduate Division concurs with the chair’s explanation, the student is sent a letter of dismissal from the program by the graduate dean, with a copy to the department.</p>
<p><strong>A partial failure.</strong> A partial failure occurs if the qualifying examination committee votes unanimously that the student passed some topics but failed others. In this instance, the following apply:</p>
<ol>
	<li>A second and final examination is required;</li>
	<li>The chair of the committee must write a letter to the student, with a copy to the Graduate Division, conveying information about his or her performance (pass, partial fail, or fail) on each of the three subject areas covered during the examination;</li>
	<li>The committee may choose to examine the student on all topics or only on those failed during the first exam, but must communicate its decision in the letter regarding the student’s performance; and</li>
	<li>The retake must be scheduled no earlier than three months after the first examination unless an exception is approved by Graduate Division. A third attempt to pass the qualifying examination is not permitted.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>A split vote</strong>. If the Qualifying Examination Committee cannot reach a unanimous decision concerning a pass, total failure, or partial failure, the chair should:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Determine the areas of disagreement; and</li>
	<li>Request that each committee member write, as required, a detailed assessment of the student’s performance for submission to the Administrative Committee of the Graduate Council.</li>
</ol>
<p>The chair’s letter should outline the progress of the examination itself, the efforts made by the committee to reach a unanimous agreement, the remaining areas of disagreement, and the chair’s own assessment of the student’s performance. Such letters may be released to the student under provisions of the 1972 Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), current Department of Health and Human Services regulations, and California public records legislation.</p>
<p>If the exam results in a split vote, the committee will only inform the student that the matter was sent to the Administrative Committee for a final decision. The student has neither passed nor failed the exam until the Administrative Committee decides the results.</p>
<h4>Student Appeals</h4>
<p>Student appeals of an oral qualifying examination outcome must be directed, in writing, to the PhD Program Committee. The committee will convene to discuss the appeal and may refer the matter to Graduate Division. If a student is not satisfied with the result of the appeals decision made by the department, the student is permitted to bring the complaint to the Graduate Division under the <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/policies/pdf/gradappeal.pdf">Formal Appeal Procedure</a>.</p>
<h3>The Dissertation</h3>
<p>The final requirement of the PhD program is the completion of a written dissertation, which presents original research, and which has been approved by the dissertation committee. On completion of the oral qualifying examination, a student advances to candidacy (see the following section) and is allowed to establish a dissertation committee. The committee is composed of three Academic Senate faculty: Chair (DCRP Faculty; cannot be OQE chair), Academic Senate representative (DCRP or non-DCRP Faculty),  Additional Member (DCRP or non-DCRP Faculty). Of the two inside members, one serves as chair of the dissertation. Note that in keeping with Graduate Division guidelines, the dissertation chair cannot be the faculty member who served as chair of the student’s oral qualifying examination committee. In some cases, a dissertation is chaired by more than one faculty. At least one of the co-chairs is a member of the department. The dissertation committee must be approved by the Graduate Division.</p>
<p>During the fieldwork and data analysis phase of the dissertation, students are urged to stay in close touch with their dissertation committees. The department expects students to be in residence during the dissertation writing phase of their study, a practice that has proven successful in ensuring that students finish their dissertations in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Note that all students are expected to complete a final research methods requirement, the doctoral writing seminar, during the post-candidacy phase of their doctoral training.</p>
<h3>In Absentia Status</h3>
<p><em>In absentia</em> registration is available to graduate students undertaking coursework or research related to their dissertation <em>outside of California</em>. Students registered <em>in absentia</em> are only assessed full health insurance fees, and 15 percent of the combined University educational and registration fees. Students <em>in absentia</em> must be enrolled in 12 units (usually 299 independent study units with their dissertation adviser). The student’s dissertation advisor's signature is required on the form.</p>
<p>Students may hold University fellowships and GSR appointments but may not hold GSI, Reader, or Tutor appointments during the <em>in absentia</em> period.</p>
<p><strong>International Students planning on registering <em>in absentia</em>.</strong> Those students in F and J status who plan to be outside California must register <em>in absentia</em> and also inform the Berkeley International Office (2299 Piedmont Avenue, 510-642-2818) of their plans.</p>
<h3>Filing Fee</h3>
<p>The filing fee is a reduced fee, one-half of the student services fee, for doctoral students who have completed all requirements for the degree except for filing the dissertation. The filing fee may only be used once during a student’s career, and the student must have the approval of their dissertation adviser.</p>
<p>To use the filing fee the student must be registered the semester (or summer session) prior to the semester they plan to use filing fee. If a student does not complete the dissertation during the semester for which the filing fee is approved, the student must pay regular registration fees during the semester in which the requirements are completed, unless they file during summer session while registered for a minimum of three units. Additional information is located on the <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/deadline/filing-fee-status/">graduate division website.</a></p>
<p><strong>Filing Fee status and international students.</strong> Filing fee status can satisfy the SEVIS requirement for international students only if the student has obtained the signature of the BIO student adviser (contact the Berkeley International Office, located in International House, 2299 Piedmont Avenue; 510-642-2818).</p>
<p><strong>Health insurance for students on Filing Fee:</strong> US resident students may purchase Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) coverage for the semester they are on approved filing fee status if they have not already purchased SHIP during a period of withdrawal beyond one semester. UHS allows the purchase of SHIP if a student is in a non-registered status for two semesters only, which pertains to both filing fee and withdrawal. For eligibility information and enrollment details, refer to the <a href="http://www.uhs.berkeley.edu/students/insurance/FilingFee.shtml">UHS website</a></p>
<h3>Residency and Unit Requirements</h3>
<p>The university requires a minimum of two years of residence and 48 units of coursework (or equivalent) for the PhD degree. Full-time students are expected to take a minimum equivalent of four courses or twelve units per semester. Credit for pre-candidacy examination preparation (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=CY%20PLAN%20602" title="CY PLAN 602" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'CY PLAN 602');">CY PLAN 602</a></span>) is limited by the University to 16 units total, and 8 units per semester. Units in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=CY%20PLAN%20299" title="CY PLAN 299" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'CY PLAN 299');">CY PLAN 299</a></span>, independent study, may also be taken by arrangement with a faculty instructor.</p>
<h4 class="Normal1">Professional Development</h4>
<p class="Preformatted">The PhD program encourages its students to build an intellectual community and to participate in national and international venues of scholarship. Doctoral candidates regularly present their research at the annual conferences of the Association of Collegiate Schools of Planning, Association of American Geographers, Association of European Schools of Planning, World Planning Schools Congress, Urban Affairs Association, and American Anthropological Association. They organize and participate in a weekly research colloquium and manage the <em>Berkeley Planning Journal</em>, a peer-reviewed academic publication. Such activities utilize the vast intellectual resources available to doctoral students at the University of California, Berkeley, both within their departments and across the campus.</p>
<p class="Normal1">PhD students are encouraged to seek appointments as Graduate Student Instructors (GSI) or Graduate Student Researchers (GSR) during their residency. The GSI Teaching &amp; Resource Center offers classes in pedagogy, and all students are expected to finish a departmental pedagogy course.</p>

<h3>Concentrations</h3>
<p>M.C.P. Students declare one or two of the four concentrations by the end of their first semester of study. Each concentration provides an opportunity for students to develop deeper knowledge and skills in a particular sub-area of planning. (<em>Note: The same course may not be used to satisfy core and concentration requirements.)</em></p>
<h4>Concentration in Environmental Planning and Healthy Cities (EPHC)</h4>
<p>Faculty Advisers: Charisma Acey, Stephen Collier, Jason Corburn, Zoé Hamstead</p>
<p>The concentration in environmental planning and healthy cities is designed to give M.C.P. students the broad knowledge necessary to analyze pressing urban environmental and health challenges, such as climate change, natural resource depletion, access to basic services and infrastructure, as well as ecologic and human health risks. The concentration emphasizes the theory and practice behind the related ideas of urban sustainability, environmental risk and justice, political ecology and human health. Students will study urban and regional environmental and human health issues in a comparative perspective, with a focus on both US and international settings. The concentration introduces students to the relationships between natural, built and social environments in cities, as well as the local, regional and global impacts of urban ecosystems and the political institutions that aim to manage these environments. The emphasis on healthy cities engages in the practices of urban public health, recognizing that planners are increasingly required to analyze and act upon how the urban environment influences human well-being.</p>

<h4>Concentration in Housing, Community and Economic Development (HCED)</h4>
<p>Faculty Advisers: Sai Balakrishnan, Teresa Caldeira, Daniel Chatman, Zachary Lamb, Ben Metcalf, Carolina Reid </p>
<p><span>The Housing, Community and Economic Development (HCED) concentration focuses on the equitable development of neighborhoods, cities and regions. From “housing as a human right” to addressing the systemic inequalities that produce segregated landscapes of poverty and wealth, this concentration is distinguished by its attention to issues of racial, social and economic justice. It seeks to expose the linkages between land use, governance, capitalism, and inequality, and explore how communities chart varied development pathways. Berkeley’s program is distinguished by two strong strands of expertise among its faculty: a theoretically informed understanding of private property and land tenure, segregation, and the right to housing, and a practice-oriented approach to housing policy, affordable housing development, and inclusionary forms of land organization, both in the context of the United States and the Global South. </span></p>
<p><span>Faculty in this concentration work on topics such as:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li>Housing and real estate development, including access to credit, the financing and construction of affordable housing, and housing policy</li>
	<li>Spatial segregation and social discrimination in both the United States and the Global South</li>
	<li>The politics of land ownership, tenure, and property rights</li>
	<li>Gentrification and displacement</li>
	<li>Forms of political participation and resistance</li>
	<li>International development, including the provision of housing, water and sanitation in informal settlements</li>
	<li>Community development and community organizing, including programs and policies designed to address longstanding patterns of residential segregation </li>
	<li>Planning for sustainability, including issues related to regional governance, resilience, affordability, and the linkages between land use and climate change</li>
</ul>
<p>Faculty within the HCED concentration draw on multidisciplinary perspectives including anthropology, economics, history, planning, and sociology, and incorporate both qualitative and quantitative methods in their research. </p>
<p>Graduates in the HCED concentration go on to work in a wide variety of positions, including nonprofit and public sector agencies Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmBH, Living Cities, Metropolitan Transportation Commission/MTC, PolicyLink, San Francisco Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development, the City of Richmond, the Association of Bay Area Governments/ABAG, and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development), affordable housing developers (e.g., BRIDGE Housing, Eden Housing, Mercy Housing, and Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation/TNDC, as well as community-based organizations (e.g., East Bay Asian Local Development Corporation/EBALDC, East Bay Housing Organizations/EBHO, Enterprise Community Partners, Inc. Local Initiatives Support Corporation/LISC and Mission Economic Development Agency/MEDA). </p>

<h4>Concentration in Transportation Policy and Planning</h4>
<p>Faculty Advisers: Daniel Chatman, Marta González, Daniel Rodríguez, Karen Trapenberg-Frick</p>
<p>The transportation planning concentration focuses on planning for urban transportation and land use systems, and interactions of transportation and land use with the built, natural, and social environments. In presenting the social, economic, and environmental implications of transportation and land use plans and policies, and promoting economic efficiency, green transport, resource conservation, and environmental protection, the courses in the concentration are focused around themes of equity, environmental justice, and social welfare. We emphasize the planning and policy challenges encountered by attempting to increase the use of environmentally sustainable travel modes such as walking, cycling and public transit, and the creation of environmentally sustainable land use patterns such as compact growth and transitoriented development. Topics covered in the core courses include the impacts of transit and highways on urban form and economic development; the impacts of urban form, transit-oriented development and new urbanism on travel behavior; governance, finance, and implementation challenges in making sustainable transport investments; the importance of highway and transit finance, municipal finance, and development finance; the promises and pitfalls of innovative sustainability solutions such as congestion pricing, parking pricing, and master development plans; streets and pedestrian- oriented designs; transportation and land use planning in the developing world; and comparative international transportation and land use policies.</p>
<p>As concerns heighten over regional mobility, air quality, global climate change, energy, and equality of access, it is increasingly important that transportation and land use planners apply a multi-disciplinary approach to the field. Accordingly, students in the concentration are encouraged to augment the department’s transportation course offerings by designing a study program, in consultation with their advisor that involves course work in other fields and departments.</p>
<p>Students in the transportation planning concentration may seek to pursue the concurrent degree program in transportation planning and engineering. This option confers both the M.C.P. and the M.S. upon students who complete 60 units of course work, normally over five semesters. For further information about concurrent M.C.P./M.S. degree requirements, contact Professor Daniel Chatman. </p>

<h4>Concentration in Urban Design</h4>
<p>Faculty Advisers: Zachary Lamb, Elizabeth Macdonald </p>
<p>Urban designers are concerned with how places look, how they feel, how they relate to natural processes, and how they work for the people who use them. The Urban Design concentration is structured to give M.C.P. students the knowledge necessary to design urban built form in relation to social, environmental, and economic concerns. “Design” is a key, operative word: urban designers shape built and natural environments both directly through their proposals for specific interventions and indirectly through their contributions to policies and plans that shape the actions of other city making actors. Urban design work ranges in scale from small public spaces and streets to neighborhoods, citywide systems, and regional strategies. The emphasis of much urban design work is on the public realm of cities, with central concerns being livability, identity, place-making, equity, environmental performance, the interface between the public and private realms, and the quality of everyday life. The concentration is equally concerned with conceptions of the “urban” and it draws on approaches from the disciplines of city planning, architecture, landscape architecture, as well as theories and methods from the social sciences with the intent of analyzing the urban condition and designing the urban realm. The studio experience is central to the urban design concentration. Working in teams and individually, students explore planning and design possibilities for urban places and learn to articulate and present their ideas through visual and verbal communication. Learning from local and global contexts, and how cities have been designed and inhabited in the past, students envision possibilities for the future. Graduates in urban design work for public agencies across scales, advocacy organizations, and private architectural, landscape, city planning, and community development firms whose clients are both public and private.</p>
<p><span>Students concentrating in urban design often have some prior design training or experience, typically in architecture, landscape architecture, environmental design, or urban planning with a design emphasis, but a design background is NOT required.</span></p>
<p>A three- or four-year joint degree program in urban design is available with the Department of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning, where students receive both the M.C.P. and the M.L.A. degree. For further information about concurrent M.C.P./M.L.A. degree requirements, contact Professor Elizabeth Macdonald. A joint degree is also available with the Department of Architecture, where students receive both M.C.P. and M.Arch degrees. For further information about concurrent M.C.P./M.Arch degree requirements, contact Professor Elizabeth Macdonald. </p>

<h4>Self-Defined Concentration</h4>
<p>Students are strongly encouraged to complete one of the defined M.C.P. concentrations. Self- defined concentrations that are NOT substantively focused on city and regional planning topics and related fields of study will NOT be approved. To develop a defined concentration, select one of the existing concentrations and select courses to develop a concentration with crosscutting expertise.</p>
<h5>Requirements</h5>
<p>Students who develop a self-defined concentration must satisfy the M.C.P. common core curriculum and identify a willing faculty advisor who can provide substantive guidance. The self-defined concentration must include three courses, including a studio, which ordinarily should be drawn from DCRP courses. However, one course may be drawn from another department if its inclusion in the concentration is justified. If a non-DCRP course is proposed, the student must supply a syllabus, and explain what compelling substantive material the course provides that DCRP courses cannot fulfill, and why the course can’t be taken as an elective.</p>
<h5>Procedures</h5>
<p>Approach the faculty advisor to discuss. Prepare a one- to two-page proposal, including a justification and an explanation about how the concentration has been conceptualized and its content. Fill out a Self-Defined Concentration Declaration form. If a non-DCRP course is proposed, the syllabus and explanation (see above) must be included as a separate attachment. Submit these materials to the faculty advisor.</p>
<p>The student’s faculty advisor must review the proposal and indicate approval by signing the form. After approval by the advisor, submit the packet to the GSAO. All submissions must be submitted to the GSAO two weeks before the deadline to declare a concentration, at the end of the first semester of study. The M.C.P. Program Committee will review the proposal and inform the student of its decision.</p>
<h3>The Thesis or Capstone Project </h3>
<p>To fulfill the capstone requirement, M.C.P. students must complete a Thesis, Client Report (CR), or Professional Report (PR), typically during the final year of their coursework. The goal of the thesis/capstone project is to support a student’s professional development by completing a significant body of work representing advanced subject and methodological expertise<strong>. Students are encouraged to review and follow the deadlines stated in the </strong><a href="https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/city-regional-planning/programs/master-of-city-planning" target="_blank"><strong>CR PR Thesis Handbook</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<h4>Master’s Thesis - Plan I</h4>
<p>The Thesis is an academic publication that undertakes original research on a topic related to planning. It is most often chosen by students who are considering a Ph.D. degree, and/or students who wish to immerse themselves in an academic research project. Theses follow standard academic research paper conventions, including a literature review, an original research question, and the development and execution of data collection and analysis. </p>
<p>Thesis requirements are set by the Graduate Division, and students must comply with the University requirement for the Plan I degree option. Thesis committees are composed of three ladder-rank faculty members, two of whom must be from DCRP (including the thesis committee chair). The third committee member must be a faculty member in another department. Theses are filed with the Graduate Degrees Office by the deadlines posted on their website. The Thesis must also satisfy style guidelines set by the Graduate Division.</p>
<p>Students pursuing the thesis option, and who are collecting data from human subjects, MUST receive clearance from UC Berkeley’s Institutional Review Board (IRB) for their research project. The Committee for Protection of Human Subjects (CPHS) serves as the IRB at UC Berkeley, and reviews and approves the use of human subjects in research. The IRB process is designed to ensure that the rights and welfare of human subjects are protected throughout their participation in research projects. Note that if thesis research includes data collection from vulnerable populations (e.g., children, unhoused individuals or families), the thesis research will NOT be eligible for expedited review and the full IRB review process can take 4-6 months to complete. </p>
<h4>Client Report (CR) - Plan II </h4>
<p>The Client Report (CR) is undertaken for an outside client or agency and aims to satisfy the needs of the sponsoring organization. It provides an opportunity for students to study a real-world planning issue by selecting appropriate analytic methods, evaluating alternative approaches, and recommending an approach or solution. The CR is carried out in a manner demonstrating high professional judgment and competence.</p>
<p><span>The CR is written under the supervision of a three-person committee. This committee must be chaired by a ladder-rank DCRP faculty member. The second reader can be a ladder rank faculty member, adjunct faculty member, or lecturer from DCRP. For dual degree students, one of the two readers can be from the joint degree department, as long as at least one committee member is ladder-rank faculty. The third member is generally the Client for whom the report was written. Final CRs are submitted electronically (with Title Page and Sign Off Form) to the GSAO and will be catalogued in the College of Environmental Design Library.</span></p>
<p>The format of the CR is determined in collaboration with the Client, and can include non-traditional options (e.g., memos, presentations, web sites, software applications, or podcasts/videos), provided that there is a short memo accompanying the final product that describes 1) the motivation and context for the project, 2) the relevance to planning, and 3) how the project contributed to the student’s professional development.</p>
<h4>Professional Research Report (PR) - Plan II</h4>
<p>The Professional Research Report (PR) is undertaken by the student independent of an external client sponsor, but is still focused on an applied policy or planning issue. The objective is to allow a student to explore in-depth an issue of interest to them, and to build additional substantive and analytical skills.</p>
<p>The PR is written under the supervision of a two-person committee. Only ladder-rank faculty (Professor, Associate Professor or Assistant Professor) can serve as Chair of PR committees. The second reader can be a ladder rank faculty member, adjunct faculty member, or lecturer from DCRP. For dual degree students, one of the two readers can be from the joint degree department, as long as the Chair is ladder rank faculty. Final PRs are submitted are submitted electronically (with Title Page and Sign Off Form) to the GSAO and will be catalogued in the College of Environmental Design Library.</p>
<p>The format of the PR is determined in collaboration with the student’s committee chair. Possible options for the PR include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A report the student produced for their internship but, for various reasons, is not a client report.</li>
	<li>An issue the student would like to learn more about, but wasn’t covered in-depth in their coursework.</li>
	<li>A project a student worked on in another class (e.g., one of the concentration courses or a studio) that they would like to extend. The student must do additional work – it cannot just be a paper or project turned in for a class.</li>
	<li>A project the student worked on as a GSR.</li>
</ul>
<p>PR’s can include non-traditional options (e.g., memos, presentations, web sites, software applications, or podcasts/videos), provided that there is a short memo accompanying the final product that describes 1) the motivation and context for the project, 2) the relevance to planning, and 3) how it contributed to the student’s professional development. </p>
<p><strong>Additional Information regarding Client Reports and Professional Reports</strong></p>
<p><span>Group Projects</span></p>
<p>Students may collaborate on a PR. However, each student’s work must be presented in a way that it can be evaluated individually. PR’s can include non-traditional options (e.g., memos, presentations, web sites, software applications, or podcasts/videos), provided that there is a short memo accompanying the final product that describes 1) the motivation and context for the project, 2) the relevance to planning, and 3) how it contributed to the student’s professional development. </p>
<p><span>Human Research Protection</span></p>
<p>The Committee for Protection of Human Subjects (CPHS) serves as the institutional review board (IRB) at UC Berkeley. The IRB must review and approve the use of human subjects in research. The process is designed to ensure that the rights and welfare of human subjects are protected throughout their participation in research projects. UC Berkeley operates within the regulations and guidelines set forth by federal authorities, primarily the Office for Human Research Protections and the Food and Drug Administration, as well as other bodies. The <a href="http://cphs.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank"><strong>Office for the Protection of Human Subjects (OPHS)</strong></a> provides operational and staffing support to the CPHS and administers all human subjects research performed on behalf of UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>To determine if your project requires CPHS/OPHS review, we suggest that you start with the links below. In addition, please consult with the chair of your committee who is <em>required</em> to be a ladder rank DCRP faculty member.</p>

<h3>Advancing to Candidacy</h3>
<p>Students advance to candidacy during their final semester of study. GSAOs will contact students at the end of the next-to-final semester of study with instructions to fill out and submit the M.C.P. Degree Checklist Form (concentration-specific). This form is submitted to the GSAOs no later than the first week of study in the last semester, and reviewed with the GSAOs in a degree check-in meeting.</p>
<p>The M.C.P. Degree Checklist Form lists all courses and units taken for completion of the M.C.P. degree, for a minimum of 48 units (36 units for concurrent degree students). As noted above, no more than a maximum of six units of 299 independent study, and a combined total of three units of 295 and 297, may be applied towards the degree. Lower division undergraduate courses (numbered 1-99) do NOT count towards the 48-unit M.C.P. requirement, nor does CYPLAN 375: Supervised Teaching in City and Regional Planning. Two-thirds of all course work must be letter-graded. For letter-graded courses, only those graded C- or better will count toward the degree. For S/U courses, only those graded Satisfactory will count toward the degree.</p>

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> The course introduces students to key paradigms of planning thought. The course is organized around the principle that histories of city planning are also about theories of planning. <br/>In addition to writing instruction, the course provides an opportunity for further professional development through students conducting interviews for their core paper assignment and drafting a resume and professional development plan outlining their academic and career goals. Students also will be exposed to practitioners in planning and related fields through guest speakers in class during the second half of the course on contemporary topics.<br/>The course Introduces students to city and regional planning ideas, history and practices and how they have shaped and responded to urban development. As histories of city planning are rooted in the quest for spatial order, the course seeks to enable students to have a deeper understanding of how space functions in tandem with history, practice and policy implementation.<br/>The course will provide instruction on writing – professional quality deliverables for master’s students and scholarly level text and orientation for doctoral students.<br/>We will discuss the power and limits of planning, planning and social change, the multiple roles in which planners find themselves, and the relationship between planning and built and natural environments. We will consider views of key stakeholders and members of the public from across the political spectrum. We will examine current pressing planning and policy issues in the context of their historical underpinnings.</p></div>

This course focuses on the deeply contested and political nature of land-use. It uses the spatial lens to situate land-use planning within wider processes of globalization. A central premise is to link land-use planning to property rights, and to ask: how is land, a spatially fixed resource with unique characteristics in each location, transformed into an asset for private ownership, an instrument of finance, a fungible asset; and what are</span><span class="deschide"> the distributive conflicts that arise from private property? The course is also committed to an exploration of how planners can move towards more emancipatory land-use practices.</span><br/>

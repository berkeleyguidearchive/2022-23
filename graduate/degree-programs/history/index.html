				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p>The Department of History offers a PhD program in History. The program prepares the student in four selected fields of study: Three fields of history (called the first, second, and third field) and one field in another discipline (called the outside field). Students indicate their choice of the first field at the time of application to the program, and they decide upon the second, third, and outside fields by the end of the first year of study.</p>
<p>The department represents a rich spectrum of research interests, collaborations, and approaches spanning 16 established fields of history: Africa, Ancient Greece and Rome, Byzantine, Early Modern Europe, East Asia: China, East Asia: Japan, Global, Jewish, Late Modern Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, Medieval Europe, Middle East, North America, Science, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. The depth and breadth of our program and the strengths of our faculty members, students, and other professionals provide an especially stimulating and congenial setting for graduate training.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://history.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="admissionstext"></a><h2>Admissions</h2><h3>Admission to the University</h3>
 <h4>Minimum Requirements for Admission</h4> <p>The following minimum requirements apply to all graduate programs and will be verified by the Graduate Division:</p> <ol> 	<li>A bachelor’s degree or recognized equivalent from an accredited institution;</li> 	<li>A grade point average of B or better (3.0);</li> 	<li>If the applicant has completed a basic degree from a country or political entity (e.g., Quebec) where English is not the official language, adequate proficiency in English to do graduate work, as evidenced by a TOEFL score of at least 90 on the iBT test, 570 on the paper-and-pencil test, or an IELTS Band score of at least 7 on a 9-point scale (note that individual programs may set higher levels for any of these); and</li> 	<li>Sufficient undergraduate training to do graduate work in the given field.</li> </ol> <h4>Applicants Who Already Hold a Graduate Degree</h4> <p>The Graduate Council views academic degrees not as vocational training certificates, but as evidence of broad training in research methods, independent study, and articulation of learning. Therefore, applicants who already have academic graduate degrees should be able to pursue new subject matter at an advanced level without the need to enroll in a related or similar graduate program.</p> <p>Programs may consider students for an additional academic master’s or professional master’s degree only if the additional degree is in a distinctly different field.</p> <p>Applicants admitted to a doctoral program that requires a master’s degree to be earned at Berkeley as a prerequisite (even though the applicant already has a master’s degree from another institution in the same or a closely allied field of study) will be permitted to undertake the second master’s degree, despite the overlap in field.</p> <p>The Graduate Division will admit students for a second doctoral degree only if they meet the following guidelines:</p> <ol> 	<li>Applicants with doctoral degrees may be admitted for an additional doctoral degree only if that degree program is in a general area of knowledge distinctly different from the field in which they earned their original degree. For example, a physics PhD could be admitted to a doctoral degree program in music or history; however, a student with a doctoral degree in mathematics would not be permitted to add a PhD in statistics.</li> 	<li>Applicants who hold the PhD degree may be admitted to a professional doctorate or professional master’s degree program if there is no duplication of training involved.</li> </ol> <p>Applicants may apply only to one single degree program or one concurrent degree program per admission cycle.</p> <h4>Required Documents for Applications</h4> <ol> 	<li><strong>Transcripts: </strong>Applicants may upload <em>unofficial </em>transcripts with your application for the departmental initial review. Unofficial transcripts must contain specific information including the name of the applicant, name of the school, all courses, grades, units, &amp; degree conferral (if applicable). </li> 	<li><strong>Letters of recommendation:</strong> Applicants may request online letters of recommendation through the online application system. Hard copies of recommendation letters must be sent directly to the program, by the recommender, not the Graduate Admissions.</li> 	<li> 	<p><strong><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">Evidence of English language proficiency:</span> </strong>All applicants who have completed a basic degree from a country or political entity in which the official language is not English are required to submit official evidence of English language proficiency. This applies to institutions from Bangladesh, Burma, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Latin America, the Middle East, the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, most European countries, and Quebec (Canada). However, applicants who, at the time of application, have already completed at least one year of full-time academic course work with grades of B or better at a US university may submit an official transcript from the US university to fulfill this requirement. The following courses will not fulfill this requirement:</p> 	<ul> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses in English as a Second Language,</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses conducted in a language other than English,</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses that will be completed after the application is submitted, and</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses of a non-academic nature.</span></p> 		</li> 	</ul> 	</li> </ol> <p style="margin-left:30pt"><span><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">Applicants who have previously applied to Berkeley must also submit new test scores that meet the current minimum requirement from one of the standardized tests. Official TOEFL score reports must be sent directly from Educational Test Services (ETS). The institution code for Berkeley is 4833 for Graduate Organizations. Official IELTS score reports must be sent electronically from the testing center to University of California, Berkeley, Graduate Division, Sproul Hall, Rm 318 MC 5900, Berkeley, CA 94720. TOEFL and IELTS score reports are only valid for two years prior to beginning the graduate program at UC Berkeley. </span></span>Note: score reports can not expire before the month of June.</p> <div> </div> <h4>Where to Apply</h4> <p>Visit the Berkeley Graduate Division <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply/" target="_blank">application page</a>. </p>

				<a name="doctoraldegreerequirementstext"></a><h2>Doctoral Degree Requirements</h2><h4>PhD Program Requirements at a Glance</h4>
<p>Students should make progress toward completing graduate coursework and language requirements as outlined in the <a href="https://history.berkeley.edu/graduate/program-guide">History Graduate Program Guide</a>. Students must pass a third-semester examination concentrating on their first field<sup>2</sup> prior to the start of their fourth semester. Before taking the doctoral qualifying examination, students must satisfy all course and language requirements. Students must take the PhD qualifying examination no later than the end of the spring semester of the third year, for students in a six-year field, and by the end of the spring semester of the fourth year, for students in a seven-year field. Advancement to doctoral candidacy immediately follows the qualifying exam upon approval of a dissertation committee and written dissertation prospectus. After advancing, students will continue to be enrolled and submit annual progress reports. Final completion of the PhD requires submission and approval of the dissertation.</p>
<h4>Program Fields of Concentration</h4>
<p>The program prepares the student in four selected fields of study: three fields of History (called the first, second, and third field) and one field in another discipline (called the fourth or outside field). Students indicate their choice of the first field at the time of application to the program and they decide upon the second, third, and outside fields by the end of the second year of study. Students are bound by normative time requirements of the first field. The graduate advisers committee must formally approve the selection of these fields, normally by the end of the second year.</p>
<p><strong>Fields</strong></p>
<p>1. Africa</p>
<p>2. Ancient Greece and Rome</p>
<p>3. Byzantine</p>
<p>4. Early Modern Europe</p>
<p>5. East Asia: China</p>
<p>6. East Asia: Japan</p>
<p>7. Global</p>
<p>8. Jewish History</p>
<p>9. Late Modern Europe</p>
<p>10. Latin America and the Caribbean</p>
<p>11. Medieval Europe</p>
<p>12. Middle East</p>
<p>13. North America</p>
<p>14. Science</p>
<p>15. South Asia</p>
<p>16. Southeast Asia</p>
<h4>PhD Coursework Requirements</h4>
<p>Students complete a minimum of 34 course units, not including language, and maintain a minimum overall grade point average of 3.0 (3.5 or above in history graduate courses).  Courses that are being applied to the program must be taken for a letter grade. The program of study must conform to the following guidelines: </p>
<p><strong>A</strong>. 16 units in the first field: two graduate seminars in any combination of 275s and 280s (both must be completed by the end of the first year) and two 285s (one should be completed by the end of the first year if possible).</p>
<p>Students in the fields of East Asia: China and East Asia: Japan have one additional required 4 unit seminar. Students in East Asia: China must take a reading seminar (280) or a survey seminar (275) in Japanese history. Students in East Asia: Japan must take a reading or survey seminar in Chinese history. Exceptions require the approval of the graduate advisor committee.</p>
<p>Students in the field of History of Science must take, in addition to other required coursework, the historical colloquium (290) in each semester of their first two years. The 290 is worth 1 unit and is graded on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory basis.</p>
<p><strong>B. </strong>4 units in the second (thematic) and 4 units in the third (limited regional/temporal) fields: graduate seminars in any combination of 275s and 280s.  </p>
<p><strong>C. </strong>3 to 4 units in the fourth/outside field: one graduate-level graded course in a field and department other than history.</p>
<p><strong>D. </strong>4 units of methodology: Historical Method and Theory (283).  Students are required to take this in their first semester.</p>
<p><strong>E. </strong>2 units of pedagogy: Teaching History Pedagogy Seminar (375).  A pedagogy course is required of all first-time graduate student instructors (GSIs). Students are required to take the Department of History’s 375 during their second semester.</p>
<p><strong>PhD Foreign Language Requirements</strong></p>
<p>The language requirements for the PhD vary by field between one and four. Students whose field requires two or more languages are advised to come to the program with significant preparation in the languages most critical to the field (e.g., students in medieval history should have intermediate Latin at the time of application). Students should attempt to complete one foreign language applicable to the selected field by the end of the first year. Please see <a href="http://history.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">history.berkeley.edu</a> for a list of language requirements by field and for options for fulfilling the language requirements. Students must satisfy all language requirements before taking the doctoral qualifying examination. Faculty in the field can help students make a plan for completing the requirements.</p>

Beyond examining influential works that continue to shape how we write, teach, and think about history, it familiarizes students with important subfields of the discipline, and seminal thinkers who helped shape them. Though the course probes no topic or approach in depth, it does aim to facilitate a working knowledge of a range of methods and theoretical vocabularies with which</span><span class="deschide"> historians should be conversant.

This class explores what is happening to higher education and the historical profession in the contemporary world and how the job market for historians is changing. The aim is to demystify the academy and the historical profession while encouraging deeper thinking about career diversity and development. We will focus on practical questions like how and when you get your reading done, how you prepare for 3rd semester and qualifying exams, visit and use archives, develop</span><span class="deschide"> research skills, prepare grant proposals, build a CV/Resume, attend conferences and present papers, publish reviews and articles. It will also address how you survive this intensification of academic labor, addressing issues such as mental health and resources for parents.</span><br/>

This class introduces graduate students to a variety of theories and techniques used in teaching history at the university. Through discussion, small group activities, and simulations, the course explores core ideas of history pedagogy. It addresses opportunities and challenges in teaching history as well as common classroom situations to develop the foundation for becoming teachers at Berkeley and beyond. The course has two primary goals:</span><span class="deschide"> (1) to prepare graduate students to teach effectively as GSIs in history classes at Berkeley; and (2) to introduce ideas, practices, and debates in teaching and learning to support graduate students' professional development into independent instructors, in and out of the classroom.</span><br/>

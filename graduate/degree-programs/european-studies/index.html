				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p>The DE in European Studies provides curricular and research resources for students who want to concentrate on European Studies within their respective disciplines and have their work formally recognized in their degree designation. Designed to bring together faculty and students from different departments, the DE is administered by the Graduate Group in European Studies and provides a unique context for rigorous cross-disciplinary research. Sponsoring departments include History, Law, Agricultural and Resource Economics, Sociology, Economics, Scandinavian, Anthropology, History of Art, German and Dutch, Political Science, Italian, Architecture, Comparative Literature, Rhetoric, Spanish and Portuguese, Interdisciplinary Studies, Slavic, and French. However, the DE is open to interested students regardless of whether their home department is officially affiliated with the DE. The program helps advance Berkeley’s position as one of the nation’s leading European Studies programs and facilitates research in and cooperation with other European universities. Students applying to the DE must be prepared to integrate high-level research in European Studies into their coursework, qualifying exam and dissertation.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="https://ies.berkeley.edu/de-european-studies" target="_blank">Visit Institute Website</a></p>

				<a name="designatedemphasisrequirementstext"></a><h2>Designated Emphasis Requirements</h2><p>Students are required to fill out a form requesting admission, listing their prior preparation in the field, and explaining their projected pathway through the program. In addition, students must submit a brief essay stating their interests and reasons for applying, a CV, a writing sample, and a letter of recommendation from a faculty member in the student’s home department indicating why and how the student would benefit from the DE. Proficiency in one European language (equivalent to level C1 in the Common European Framework) other than English is a requirement for admission. Students will be required to provide evidence confirming their foreign language proficiency. Students who are unable to provide the necessary evidence regarding their foreign language proficiency will be asked to have their foreign language proficiency examined and officially acknowledged in a letter written by a UCB lecturer or faculty member.</p>
<p>Students must be admitted to the DE prior to taking their qualifying exams. Admission will be determined by the members of the executive committee on the basis of how coherently and logically the student can articulate the value of the DE for her/his larger course of study and career goals, the quality of the student’s written work, and her/his foreign language proficiencies. The Executive Committee will strive to build a diverse student group, comprising students from a wide range of departments and with a variety of language skills.</p>
<p>The number of students to be accepted in the program is limited to eight per year in order to ensure that each student receives strong individual support.</p>
<h3>Coursework/Curriculum</h3>
<p>Students admitted to the Designated Emphasis Program must complete the following requirements:</p>
<p>1. Students will be required to complete two required core courses offered by the DE (these courses do  not need to be taken sequentially):</p>
<ul>
	<li>European Studies (EUST) 200: Ideas of Europe and European Identities. This course engages with a critical reflection on the notion of Europe and European identities, either from a historical and/or a contemporary perspective. It will provide critical explanatory analysis of issues relating to European history, European borders, integration and disintegration, migration, transnational Europe, postcolonial Europe, and/or the position of Europe in a globalized world. Subject to approval by the Advising Committee, European Studies 200 can be cross-listed/room-shared with an existing course taught by any faculty member of the Graduate Group at one of the departments that have officially committed to sponsor the new DE.</li>
	<li>European Studies (EUST) 201: European Institutions and Social Conflicts. This course engages with a reflection on European institutions and social conflicts, either from a historical and/or contemporary perspective. It will provide a critical explanatory analysis of issues relating to European institutions such as the EU Commission, Council, Parliament and Court of Justice, the European Central Bank, the European Investment Bank, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, as well as general issues relating to the European economy and/or social and political conflicts within Europe. Subject to approval by the Advising Committee, European Studies 201 can be cross-listed/room-shared with an existing course taught by any faculty member of the Graduate Group at one of the departments that have officially committed to sponsor the new DE. </li>
</ul>

Every semester, either EUST 200 and/or EUST 201 will be offered.</p>
<p>2. Besides the two required core courses, students will be required to complete two approved electives.</p>
<p>The two electives will be chosen in consultation with the head graduate adviser. These courses will support the interdisciplinary nature of the program with attention to the individual students’ research interests. At least one of these electives must be taken outside the student’s home department.</p>

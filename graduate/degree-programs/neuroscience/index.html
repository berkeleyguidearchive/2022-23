				<a name="admissionstext"></a><h2>Admissions</h2><h3 class="Normal1">Admission to the University</h3>
 <h4>Minimum Requirements for Admission</h4> <p>The following minimum requirements apply to all graduate programs and will be verified by the Graduate Division:</p> <ol> 	<li>A bachelor’s degree or recognized equivalent from an accredited institution;</li> 	<li>A grade point average of B or better (3.0);</li> 	<li>If the applicant has completed a basic degree from a country or political entity (e.g., Quebec) where English is not the official language, adequate proficiency in English to do graduate work, as evidenced by a TOEFL score of at least 90 on the iBT test, 570 on the paper-and-pencil test, or an IELTS Band score of at least 7 on a 9-point scale (note that individual programs may set higher levels for any of these); and</li> 	<li>Sufficient undergraduate training to do graduate work in the given field.</li> </ol> <h4>Applicants Who Already Hold a Graduate Degree</h4> <p>The Graduate Council views academic degrees not as vocational training certificates, but as evidence of broad training in research methods, independent study, and articulation of learning. Therefore, applicants who already have academic graduate degrees should be able to pursue new subject matter at an advanced level without the need to enroll in a related or similar graduate program.</p> <p>Programs may consider students for an additional academic master’s or professional master’s degree only if the additional degree is in a distinctly different field.</p> <p>Applicants admitted to a doctoral program that requires a master’s degree to be earned at Berkeley as a prerequisite (even though the applicant already has a master’s degree from another institution in the same or a closely allied field of study) will be permitted to undertake the second master’s degree, despite the overlap in field.</p> <p>The Graduate Division will admit students for a second doctoral degree only if they meet the following guidelines:</p> <ol> 	<li>Applicants with doctoral degrees may be admitted for an additional doctoral degree only if that degree program is in a general area of knowledge distinctly different from the field in which they earned their original degree. For example, a physics PhD could be admitted to a doctoral degree program in music or history; however, a student with a doctoral degree in mathematics would not be permitted to add a PhD in statistics.</li> 	<li>Applicants who hold the PhD degree may be admitted to a professional doctorate or professional master’s degree program if there is no duplication of training involved.</li> </ol> <p>Applicants may apply only to one single degree program or one concurrent degree program per admission cycle.</p> <h4>Required Documents for Applications</h4> <ol> 	<li><strong>Transcripts: </strong>Applicants may upload <em>unofficial </em>transcripts with your application for the departmental initial review. Unofficial transcripts must contain specific information including the name of the applicant, name of the school, all courses, grades, units, &amp; degree conferral (if applicable). </li> 	<li><strong>Letters of recommendation:</strong> Applicants may request online letters of recommendation through the online application system. Hard copies of recommendation letters must be sent directly to the program, by the recommender, not the Graduate Admissions.</li> 	<li> 	<p><strong><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">Evidence of English language proficiency:</span> </strong>All applicants who have completed a basic degree from a country or political entity in which the official language is not English are required to submit official evidence of English language proficiency. This applies to institutions from Bangladesh, Burma, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Latin America, the Middle East, the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, most European countries, and Quebec (Canada). However, applicants who, at the time of application, have already completed at least one year of full-time academic course work with grades of B or better at a US university may submit an official transcript from the US university to fulfill this requirement. The following courses will not fulfill this requirement:</p> 	<ul> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses in English as a Second Language,</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses conducted in a language other than English,</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses that will be completed after the application is submitted, and</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses of a non-academic nature.</span></p> 		</li> 	</ul> 	</li> </ol> <p style="margin-left:30pt"><span><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">Applicants who have previously applied to Berkeley must also submit new test scores that meet the current minimum requirement from one of the standardized tests. Official TOEFL score reports must be sent directly from Educational Test Services (ETS). The institution code for Berkeley is 4833 for Graduate Organizations. Official IELTS score reports must be sent electronically from the testing center to University of California, Berkeley, Graduate Division, Sproul Hall, Rm 318 MC 5900, Berkeley, CA 94720. TOEFL and IELTS score reports are only valid for two years prior to beginning the graduate program at UC Berkeley. </span></span>Note: score reports can not expire before the month of June.</p> <div> </div> <h4>Where to Apply</h4> <p>Visit the Berkeley Graduate Division <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply/" target="_blank">application page</a>. </p>
<h3 class="Normal1">Admission to the Program</h3>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Applicants to the program should have a bachelor's degree from a four-year college and at least one year of laboratory experience.

				<a name="doctoraldegreerequirementstext"></a><h2>Doctoral Degree Requirements</h2><h3>Normative Time Requirements</h3>
<h4 class="Normal1CxSpFirst">Normative Time to Advancement</h4>
<h6 class="Normal1CxSpMiddle"><strong>Step I: Lab Rotations and Presentations, First Year Classes</strong></h6>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">During the first year of graduate study, each neuroscience graduate student spends three 10-week periods performing research projects in different faculty laboratories. The goal is to expose students to different techniques and approaches in neuroscience and to provide training in experimental design, critical analysis of data, and presentation of research findings. Rotations also allow students to identify the laboratory in which their thesis research will be performed. Rotation research is graded and receives academic credit. This is accomplished by enrolling in NEUROSC 291A/B, a year-long course, during the rotation year. Also during the first-year students take NEUROSC 290A/B Methods &amp; Career Skills Classes which <span>introduce a broad range of modern neuroscience research methods in didactic lectures and provide advising in initial career skills.  </span>NEUROSC<span> 290A (Fall) includes a survey of cutting-edge research methods, advising on how to choose a thesis mentor, training in scientific rigor and reproducibility, and an introduction to the use and misuse of statistics in neuroscience research. </span>NEUROSC<span> 290B (Spring) includes in-depth training on how to give a top-notch scientific talk, advising on how to write effective research papers, and on scientific project management. Finally, student also enroll in MCELLBI 293C during the spring of their first year </span>to ensure that research trainees receive ample training in Responsible Conduct in Research, and to gain an understanding of federal, state, and UC Berkeley policies and resources available to further support their research endeavors.</p>
<h6 class="Normal1CxSpMiddle"><strong>Step II: Qualifying Exam</strong></h6>
<p>Students complete an oral qualifying exam during the spring semester of Year 2. <span>The examination has three parts: Thesis Proposal, Related Research Areas, and Foundational Questions in Neuroscience. The thesis proposal is in the form of a written, NIH-style grant proposal, which is turned in to the committee, and then defended orally. Related Research Areas are identified cooperatively by the student and his/her committee prior to the exam, and are chosen to be complementary to the main thesis research subject. These areas are examined orally. The Foundational Questions in Neuroscience are designed to test broad knowledge in Neuroscience. These are a published list of questions, the same for all students, that are available upon entry to the program. These questions are designed to test basic common knowledge of neuroscience facts and principles, and a subset of them are examined orally during the qualifying exam. During the exam, students must demonstrate the ability to recognize fundamentally important research problems, propose relevant experimental approaches, and display comprehensive knowledge of appropriate disciplinary areas and related subjects. </span><span>Students must pass the qualifying examination before advancing to doctoral candidacy.</span></p>
<h4 class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Normative Time in Candidacy</h4>
<h6><strong>Step III: Dissertation</strong></h6>
<p>Students undertake research for the PhD dissertation under a four-person committee in charge of their research and dissertation. Students do original research using a wide variety of cutting-edge neuroscience methods. During this time, students must meet at least annual with their thesis committee to discuss dissertation progress, review experimental results, set goals, and ensure students are adhering to appropriate timelines to completion. The students then write a dissertation based on the results of their research. </p>
<h6><strong>STEP IV: Dissertation Presentation/Formal Exit Seminar</strong></h6>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">There is no formal defense of the completed dissertation. However, Neuroscience students are required to publicly present a thesis seminar about their dissertation research in their final year. <span>On completion of the research and approval of the dissertation by the committee, the students are awarded the doctorate.</span></p>
<h4>Total Normative Time</h4>
<p>Normative time to advancement is 2 years. Total normative time is 5.7 years.</p>
<h3>Curriculum</h3>
<h5>Pedagogy, Rotations, Ethics, &amp; Seminar Courses </h5>
<p>Student must take all of the following courses. Pedagogy, Rotations, and Ethics courses are taken in year 1. Brain Lunch Seminar is taken in Years 1, 2, and 4.</p>

<h4 class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Teaching</h4>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Neuroscience students are required to serve as graduate student instructors (GSIs) for two semesters. Whenever possible, GSI assignments are determined with an eye toward student research interests. Teaching occurs during fall semester of the second year and spring semester of the third. Teaching affords students supervised experience in a variety of educational situations, including labs, discussion sections, and demonstrations. GSIs also participate in record-keeping, grading, advising, and student consultations.</p>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">GSIs are evaluated by both supervising faculty and the students they teach. These evaluations become a permanent part of the student file. Deserving GSIs are nominated for the Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award.</p>

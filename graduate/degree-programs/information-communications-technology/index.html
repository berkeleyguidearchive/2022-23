<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-fb89524d-7fff-6c70-77b8-0a3f89fe88d5">These technologies can be employed to address problems in the developing world as well, where a large proportion of the population lives in poverty and without access to adequate food, nutritional information, education, health care, credit, and other social and economic opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-fb89524d-7fff-6c70-77b8-0a3f89fe88d5">The Information and Communication Technologies and Development certificate program equips students to work across boundaries to identify, evaluate, and implement solutions to pressing societal problems in the developing world.</span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-fb89524d-7fff-6c70-77b8-0a3f89fe88d5">The program has three broad components:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-fb89524d-7fff-6c70-77b8-0a3f89fe88d5">Understanding processes of technology diffusion and adoption in developing regions.</span></p>

	<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-fb89524d-7fff-6c70-77b8-0a3f89fe88d5">Acting through the design and deployment of information systems in close collaboration with the communities they are meant to support.</span></p>

	<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-fb89524d-7fff-6c70-77b8-0a3f89fe88d5">Redefining the dialogue about the role of technology in the global economic and political processes that affect developing regions.</span></p>

</ul>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-fb89524d-7fff-6c70-77b8-0a3f89fe88d5">The Graduate Certificate in Information and Communication Technologies and Development is issued by the School of Information but is open to all UC Berkeley graduate students. The certificate is in addition to a student’s regular degree program and is designed to complement a wide range of existing degree programs. Upon graduation, you will be issued a certificate in addition to your diploma, and completion of the certificate program will be noted on your official transcript.</span></p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/ictd" target="_blank">Visit Program Website</a></p>

<h3><strong>Fieldwork</strong></h3>
<p>Certificate students must complete at least six weeks of eligible, approved development-focused fieldwork.</p>
<p>The goal of the field work requirement is to give students a hands-on experience of day-to-day happenings in a development context. While long-term ethnographic research focuses on forces, factors, histories, and people who play decisive roles in determining social outcomes issues, by situating local relationships, understandings and meanings, within shifting policies and economies, a six-week field trip is geared more towards getting a sense of the way a local partner functions within a community and the lifestyles, everyday interactions, and problems faced by the communities these partners serve.</p>
<p><strong>Eligible Fieldwork</strong></p>
<p>Most eligible fieldwork will be conducted abroad, with an organization involved in development. Students may also receive approval for fieldwork performed locally, if the project is with an organization focused on development and the student’s work is clearly development-focused. Eligible fieldwork may include organizations that are not primarily development-oriented, if the student is embedded in a division focused on development or ‘emerging markets.’ In some cases, fieldwork may be eligible even if the organization has no international presence, if it has a clear non-profit social mission, working with local underprivileged or marginalized communities. Fieldwork conducted independently (not through an established organization) may be eligible, particularly for Ph.D. students, if the student can demonstrate the project’s development focus.</p>
<p><strong>Arranging Fieldwork</strong></p>
<p>We expect that most eligible fieldwork will be conducted as an internship with a development organization (although some Ph.D. students may instead perform independent research fieldwork).</p>
<p>Students are responsible for arranging their own fieldwork or internships. Trips are usually arranged in conjunction with a local partner. Students will receive limited assistance from I School faculty through their connections and can make use of several highly active ICTD-themed mailing lists, as well as applying their own initiative to secure fieldwork or internship opportunities.</p>
<p>No dedicated funding is available to support student fieldwork; students should seek paid opportunities or otherwise arrange funding themselves (for example, through dissertation grant funds such as from the NSF or Fulbright Foundation).</p>
<p><strong>Fieldwork Approval</strong></p>
<p>Students must submit the Fieldwork Approval Form for approval of the fieldwork for the ICTD certificate. All projects must be approved by the I School ICTD advisory committee.</p>
<p>Deadline: When possible, the form should be submitted at least two months before the expected start date of the fieldwork, in order to allow time for feedback. However, in exceptional cases, the Fieldwork Approval Form can be submitted after the completion of the fieldwork.</p>

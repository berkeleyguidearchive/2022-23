<p>Through coursework, research mentoring, and professional development, the Designated Emphasis in Development Engineering (DE in DevEng) prepares students to develop, pilot, and evaluate technological interventions designed to improve human and economic development within complex, low-resource settings. </p>
<p>The DE in DevEng is an interdisciplinary training program for UC Berkeley doctoral students from any department whose dissertation research includes topics related to the application of technology to address the needs of people living in poverty. Students from all departments can <a href="https://blumcenter.berkeley.edu/academics/development-engineering/apply/" target="_blank">apply</a>. </p>
<p>With initial support from <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/videos/us-global-development-lab" target="_blank">USAID’s Global Development Lab</a>, the program builds upon ongoing research in technological innovations, human-centered design, development economics, remote sensing and monitoring, data science, and impact analysis at UC Berkeley. The program also features a National Science Foundation Traineeship for Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy, and Water Systems, <a href="https://blumcenter.berkeley.edu/academics/infews/" target="_blank">InFEWS</a>.</p>
<p>DevEng students are connected to an ecosystem of researchers and practitioners at Berkeley via the <a href="https://developmentengineering.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/" target="_blank">Graduate Group in Development Engineering</a>, and also have access to a dynamic global network.</p>
<p>What is a Designated Emphasis? A “Designated Emphasis” (DE) is a campus-wide system that provides doctoral students with certification in specialties outside their home discipline, to be added to their doctorates.</p>
<p><u><strong>Requirements</strong></u></p>
<p>The Designated Emphasis in Development Engineering requires five courses (two core courses plus three electives). The course requirements are in addition to, but may overlap with, the Ph.D. course requirements of your home department. All course work for the DE should be taken for a letter grade.</p>
<p>The two core courses are:</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px"><strong>DevEng C200: Design, Evaluate, and Scale Development Technologies (3 units)</strong>: DevEng C200 is co-taught each fall term by one technologist and one social scientist. Students in the DevEng DE must complete this course before their qualifying exams. Professors from the pool of faculty in the Graduate Group in Development Engineering rotate as course instructors. The course is offered for three units credit as DevEng C200, Mech Eng C200 or MBA 290T. Master’s students will be permitted to take the core course as space permits and with permission of the instructors. Dev Eng C200 is organized around analysis and application of case studies by multidisciplinary student teams according to three thematic modules.</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px"><strong>DevEng 210: Development Engineering Research and Practice Seminar (1–2 units)</strong>: This course provides DevEng students with a context and community within which their research projects can be refined and developed. The seminar focuses on work-in-progress presentations by students, post doctoral scholars, and faculty within the DIL ecosystem.  The research seminar can be taken before or after the qualifying examination, and students can take it more than once.</p>
<p>Students must take their three electives from at least two of the three thematic modules within the Dev Eng program. The three modules are: Project Design, Evaluation Techniques and Methods for Measuring Social Impact, and Technology Development. Of the three electives, only one can be from the student’s home department.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all students must apply and be accepted to the Designated Emphasis in Development Engineering <em>at least one semester before their qualifying examination</em>. DevEng C200 must also be taken prior to qualifying exam. At least one faculty member of the Graduate Group in Development Engineering must participate in the qualifying examination committee, and will evaluate the exam from relevant perspectives. When all course work and designated emphasis requirements have been completed, this final report must be submitted to the Graduate Student Affairs Officer in 750 Davis Hall for verification of completion of the designated emphasis at the latest one month prior to your filing the dissertation. Lastly, the dissertation must contain themes relevant to the field of Development Engineering (e.g. technology for economic and social development). More about the DE's requirements can be found <a href="https://blumcenter.berkeley.edu/academics/development-engineering/requirements/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

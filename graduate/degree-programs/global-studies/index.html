				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p>The MA degree in Global Studies (GS) is a one-year Masters program. It is an interdisciplinary program designed to provide the fundamentals of contemporary international issues as well as detailed knowledge on particular world regions or countries. The MA degree in Global Studies provides wide flexibility in crafting an individual interdisciplinary program. Students tailor the content of their programs within a defined framework to suit their interests. Specific course work is chosen in consultation with a faculty adviser.</p>

				<a name="mastersdegreerequirementstext"></a><h2>Master's Degree Requirements</h2><ol>
	<li>Students must COMPLETE a minimum of 24 units, at least twelve of which must be graduate-level course work (courses numbered 200-299). Two-thirds of <em>all</em> course work must be letter-graded. Thus no more than a third of all units may be taken on an S/U or P/NP grading basis.</li>
	<li>Students are required to complete two Global Studies proseminars, one in the fall, the other in the spring. They must also enroll in at least two social science and two area studies courses (in the same area).</li>
	<li>Capstone – All students must undergo a comprehensive examination, with both written and oral components. A committee consisting of three faculty members will direct the examination for all of the students in any given cohort, which will require synthesis of material from student coursework.</li>

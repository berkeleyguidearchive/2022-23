				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p>Berkeley Social Welfare educates students for leadership in the field of social welfare and the profession of social work.  Since 1944 we have prepared over 11,000 social work professionals and social work scholars for leadership in a range of research, teaching, advanced practice, and management roles. We offer two graduate degrees: the professional Master of Social Welfare (MSW); and the academic Doctor of Philosophy in Social Welfare (PhD).</p>
<h2>Master of Social Welfare (MSW)</h2>
<p>Berkeley Social Welfare offers the professional Master of Social Welfare (MSW) degree, which is fully accredited by the Council on Social Work Education (<a href="https://www.cswe.org/Accreditation">CSWE</a>). S<span>tudents are prepared to practice with specialized skills at specific intervention levels and are thoroughly grounded in social science knowledge, social welfare policies, and social service organizations. </span></p>
<ul>
	<li>W<span>e train social workers for a range of leadership and advanced practice roles in the profession.</span></li>
	<li>We create a spirit of critical inquiry and emphasize the use of tested knowledge and theory in developing and applying intervention methods.</li>
	<li>We prepare students for professional responsibility in the field of social welfare and the institutional systems that comprise it.</li>
	<li>We educate students to advance social justice.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>All MSW students complete a foundation curriculum in generalist social work practice; an advanced curriculum that prepares them for practice in a chosen area of specialization; and a field education curriculum including agency-based field placements and integrative field seminars.</span></p>
<h3><span>Full-time MSW Program</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://socialwelfare.berkeley.edu/academics/masters-degree-programs/msw">Berkeley MSW Program</a> is a two-year, full-time degree program. All students follow a prescribed, full-time (minimum 12 units per semester) program of work, preparing them for both generalist and specialized practice.</p>
<h3>FlexMSW Advanced Standing Program</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://socialwelfare.berkeley.edu/academics/masters-degrees-certificates/flexmsw/flexmsw-advanced-standing">FlexMSW Advanced Standing</a> degree program is available to qualified working professionals in the field of social work who have a professional baccalaureate degree in social work from a program accredited by the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE). FlexMSW Advanced Standing students complete a 27-unit program of study over a one year period.</p>
<h3>FlexMSW Extended Program</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://socialwelfare.berkeley.edu/academics/masters-degrees-certificates/flexmsw/flexmsw-extended">FlexMSW Extended Program</a> is a three-year MSW degree track option for qualified working professionals in the field of social work and otherwise qualified students who are not able to participate in a traditional full-time MSW professional degree program. FlexMSW Extended Program students enroll on a part-time basis and complete the same 54-unit program of study as traditional full-time MSW students, only over a period of three part-time years (inclusive of two summer sessions), instead of two full-time years.</p>
<p><em>NOTE: Berkeley Social Welfare will not be accepting applications for Fall 2023 admission to either FlexMSW Program track. </em></p>

<h4><strong>Coursework in Statistics and Methods</strong></h4>
<p>Social Welfare doctoral students are required to complete at least six courses in statistics and/or methods. At least four courses must be approved statistics courses. The remaining two courses may be either statistics or methods. These courses are intended to deepen a skill set needed for an ongoing program of research. Students work with their PhD faculty advisor to choose these courses from among those approved by the Doctoral Curriculum Committee. Courses must be graduate-level courses (200 and above) and may be offered by any department on campus.</p>
<h4><strong>Elective in Social Science Theory</strong></h4>
<p>Social Welfare doctoral students are required to complete at least one letter-graded course focused on basic-discipline social science theory, before or during the semester of the Qualifying Exam.</p>
<h4><strong>First Year Comprehensive Exam</strong></h4>
<p>At the end of their first year in the program, students are required to demonstrate mastery of a broad base of knowledge in social welfare by completing a competency exam based upon knowledge gained in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOC%20WEL%20279" title="SOC WEL 279" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOC WEL 279');">SOC WEL 279</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOC%20WEL%20289A" title="SOC WEL 289A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOC WEL 289A');">SOC WEL 289A</a></span>. </p>
<h4><strong>Qualifying Paper</strong></h4>
<p>A Qualifying Paper (QP), which serves as a preliminary examination, is due at the end of the second year of the PhD program. Students work with their primary faculty advisor to submit a 1-2 page statement of their proposed Qualifying Paper topic to the PhD Faculty Chair for approval by October of the second year. The QP is expected to synthesize and critically evaluate an important, broad body of literature about an intellectual question related to a social problem. After the QP is satisfactorily completed, students must (a) declare two fields of expertise on which he or she will be examined by a Qualifying Examination committee, and (b) complete a Dissertation Prospectus. The fields of expertise may relate to the QP, must represent two broad and important bodies of literature related to a social problem(s), and must be approved by the PhD Chair in consultation with the student’s PhD Faculty Advisor. The fields of expertise must be broad (e.g., poverty/inequality and mental health; child development and domestic violence; substance abuse and prevention science).</p>
<h4><strong>Dissertation Prospectus</strong></h4>
<p>A Dissertation Prospectus must be completed well in advance of taking the Qualifying Examination. The prospectus must summarize the relevant literature, describe the issue or problem to be addressed (with clear study aims), and focus on the plan of research—including the proposed methodology, data sources, and/or analyses to be used, and a tentative timeline for project completion.</p>
<h4><strong>Qualifying Examination</strong></h4>
<p>The qualifying examination is a three-hour oral exam assessing mastery of the student's chosen fields of study and written materials submitted for the examination. It is conducted by a committee of five faculty members proposed by the student and approved by the Graduate Division. When passed, this examination marks the completion of required course work, mastery of the fields of study, and advancement to candidacy.</p>
<h4><strong>Dissertation</strong></h4>
<p>Once advanced to candidacy, doctoral students pursue a research agenda that will offer an original contribution to knowledge in the field. The dissertation is the final demonstration of scholarly, research, and professional abilities. Upon final signature of approval by the dissertation committee and submission to the Graduate Division, students are awarded the doctoral degree.</p>

<h2>Concurrent Degree in Social Welfare and Public Health</h2>
<p>Berkeley Social Welfare and the <a href="http://sph.berkeley.edu/concurrent-degrees/mswmph-school-social-welfare" target="_blank">School of Public Health</a> offer a Concurrent Degree program option for interdisciplinary preparation in the fields of social welfare and public health, leading to the Master of Social Welfare (MSW) and Master of Public Health (MPH) degrees. A major characteristic of public health social work is the combination of an epidemiological approach from Public Health and a bio-psychosocial approach from Social Work. The combined interventions focus on population groups within the context of community.</p>
<p>To complete the <a href="https://socialwelfare.berkeley.edu/msw-student-handbook/mswmph-degree-requirements">MSW/MPH Concurrent Degree</a> program and earn both the MSW and MPH, a student must be admitted to the program and complete 90 units of course work in Social Welfare and Public Health, which includes 23 units related to off-campus field education, over 3 years. One year each is dedicated to foundation curriculum in social welfare and public health. The third year is a combination of advanced social welfare and public health curriculum that results in a joint Master's capstone that addresses the knowledge of both fields.</p>
<p>Prospective applicants may reach out to either school for more information about this program.</p>

Pursuing the MSW degree with Advanced Standing status allows eligible students with accredited professional baccalaureate degrees to bypass the foundational components of the MSW curriculum, given their prior exposure to social work foundational content in their undergraduate degree programs, and enter the specialized portion of the program directly.</p>
<p><span>Prospective students must apply and be admitted directly into the FlexMSW Advanced Standing degree track.</span></p>
<p>To be eligible for admission to the FlexMSW degree program, prospective applicants:</p>
<ul>
	<li>must hold an accredited professional bachelor's degree in social work (BASW or BSW), which must have been conferred within the past five years.</li>
	<li>must meet all other <a class="openberkeley-theme-base-file-link-icons-processed" href="https://socialwelfare.berkeley.edu/admissions/msw-admissions/msw-admission-eligibility-requirements">admissions eligibility requirements</a> for admission to a Berkeley Social Welfare master's degree program.</li>
</ul>
<p>The FlexMSW Advanced Standing degree requires a <strong>minimum of 27 units</strong> for degree conferral, including 14 units earned in Field Education. The program is designed to be completed in one calendar year (August to August) over three consecutive semesters (fall, spring and summer). Upon successful completion of all requirements, students are awarded the Master of Social Welfare (MSW) degree, conferred in August.</p>
<p>All FlexMSW Advanced Standing students follow a prescribed plan of study, as shown below, in the MSW specialization area of Strengthening Children, Youth and Families (<a class="openberkeley-theme-base-file-link-icons-processed" href="https://socialwelfare.berkeley.edu/academics/masters-degrees-certificates/master-social-welfare-msw/SCYF">SCYF</a>):</p>

<p>Prospective students must apply and be admitted directly into the FlexMSW Extended Program degree track. Once admitted to any MSW degree track at Berkeley, students are not permitted to switch from full-time to the FlexMSW Extended option, or from the FlexMSW Extended option to the full-time MSW Program.</p>
<p>The FlexMSW Extended Program requires the <strong>same program of study and minimum total of 54 units</strong> as the full-time Berkeley MSW Program plan, including 25 units earned in field education. The FlexMSW Extended degree track is designed to be completed in eight semesters over three calendar years (August to August), inclusive of two summer terms. Upon successful completion of all requirements, students are awarded the Master of Social Welfare (MSW) degree, typically conferred in August.</p>

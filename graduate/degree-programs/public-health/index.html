The School of Public Health also offers academic degrees in </span><a href="/2022-23/graduate/degree-programs/biostatistics/">Biostatistics</a> (MA, PhD), <a href="/2022-23/graduate/degree-programs/environmental-health-sciences/">Environmental Health Sciences</a> (MS, PhD), <a href="/2022-23/graduate/degree-programs/epidemiology/">Epidemiology</a> (MS, PhD), <a href="/2022-23/graduate/degree-programs/health-medical-sciences-program/">Health and Medical Sciences</a> (MS), <a href="/2022-23/graduate/degree-programs/health-policy/">Health Policy</a> (PhD), and <a href="/2022-23/graduate/degree-programs/infectious-diseases-immunity/">Infectious Diseases &amp; Immunity</a> (PhD).</p>
<h3>Master of Public Health (MPH)</h3>
<p>The program of study leading to the professional MPH degree is based on a series of foundation courses. In addition, MPH students concentrate in one of the following areas: Biostatistics, Environmental Health Sciences, Epidemiology (11-month), Epidemiology/Biostatistics, Health and Social Behavior, Health Policy and Management, Global Health and Environment, Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology, Interdisciplinary, Maternal, Child, and Adolescent Health, and Public Health Nutrition.</p>
<p>The MPH degree is available in a residential program on campus or through an <a href="http://onlinemph.berkeley.edu/">On-Campus/Online MPH</a> program. The hybrid program requires two accelerated on-campus sessions, while all remaining coursework is completed online.</p>
<h3>Doctor of Public Health (DrPH)</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://sph.berkeley.edu/areas-study/doctor-public-health">Doctor of Public Health (DrPH)</a> curriculum is based on a comprehensive body of knowledge in the field of public health and its related disciplines, and the investigation of significant problems in public health practice.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://sph.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit School Website</a></p>

				<a name="admissionstext"></a><h2>Admissions</h2><h3>Admission to the University</h3>
 <h4>Minimum Requirements for Admission</h4> <p>The following minimum requirements apply to all graduate programs and will be verified by the Graduate Division:</p> <ol> 	<li>A bachelor’s degree or recognized equivalent from an accredited institution;</li> 	<li>A grade point average of B or better (3.0);</li> 	<li>If the applicant has completed a basic degree from a country or political entity (e.g., Quebec) where English is not the official language, adequate proficiency in English to do graduate work, as evidenced by a TOEFL score of at least 90 on the iBT test, 570 on the paper-and-pencil test, or an IELTS Band score of at least 7 on a 9-point scale (note that individual programs may set higher levels for any of these); and</li> 	<li>Sufficient undergraduate training to do graduate work in the given field.</li> </ol> <h4>Applicants Who Already Hold a Graduate Degree</h4> <p>The Graduate Council views academic degrees not as vocational training certificates, but as evidence of broad training in research methods, independent study, and articulation of learning. Therefore, applicants who already have academic graduate degrees should be able to pursue new subject matter at an advanced level without the need to enroll in a related or similar graduate program.</p> <p>Programs may consider students for an additional academic master’s or professional master’s degree only if the additional degree is in a distinctly different field.</p> <p>Applicants admitted to a doctoral program that requires a master’s degree to be earned at Berkeley as a prerequisite (even though the applicant already has a master’s degree from another institution in the same or a closely allied field of study) will be permitted to undertake the second master’s degree, despite the overlap in field.</p> <p>The Graduate Division will admit students for a second doctoral degree only if they meet the following guidelines:</p> <ol> 	<li>Applicants with doctoral degrees may be admitted for an additional doctoral degree only if that degree program is in a general area of knowledge distinctly different from the field in which they earned their original degree. For example, a physics PhD could be admitted to a doctoral degree program in music or history; however, a student with a doctoral degree in mathematics would not be permitted to add a PhD in statistics.</li> 	<li>Applicants who hold the PhD degree may be admitted to a professional doctorate or professional master’s degree program if there is no duplication of training involved.</li> </ol> <p>Applicants may apply only to one single degree program or one concurrent degree program per admission cycle.</p> <h4>Required Documents for Applications</h4> <ol> 	<li><strong>Transcripts: </strong>Applicants may upload <em>unofficial </em>transcripts with your application for the departmental initial review. Unofficial transcripts must contain specific information including the name of the applicant, name of the school, all courses, grades, units, &amp; degree conferral (if applicable). </li> 	<li><strong>Letters of recommendation:</strong> Applicants may request online letters of recommendation through the online application system. Hard copies of recommendation letters must be sent directly to the program, by the recommender, not the Graduate Admissions.</li> 	<li> 	<p><strong><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">Evidence of English language proficiency:</span> </strong>All applicants who have completed a basic degree from a country or political entity in which the official language is not English are required to submit official evidence of English language proficiency. This applies to institutions from Bangladesh, Burma, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Latin America, the Middle East, the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, most European countries, and Quebec (Canada). However, applicants who, at the time of application, have already completed at least one year of full-time academic course work with grades of B or better at a US university may submit an official transcript from the US university to fulfill this requirement. The following courses will not fulfill this requirement:</p> 	<ul> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses in English as a Second Language,</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses conducted in a language other than English,</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses that will be completed after the application is submitted, and</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses of a non-academic nature.</span></p> 		</li> 	</ul> 	</li> </ol> <p style="margin-left:30pt"><span><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">Applicants who have previously applied to Berkeley must also submit new test scores that meet the current minimum requirement from one of the standardized tests. Official TOEFL score reports must be sent directly from Educational Test Services (ETS). The institution code for Berkeley is 4833 for Graduate Organizations. Official IELTS score reports must be sent electronically from the testing center to University of California, Berkeley, Graduate Division, Sproul Hall, Rm 318 MC 5900, Berkeley, CA 94720. TOEFL and IELTS score reports are only valid for two years prior to beginning the graduate program at UC Berkeley. </span></span>Note: score reports can not expire before the month of June.</p> <div> </div> <h4>Where to Apply</h4> <p>Visit the Berkeley Graduate Division <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply/" target="_blank">application page</a>. </p>

<h3>Concurrent Degree Requirements</h3>
<h5><a id="Health Social MPH-MCP" name="Health Social MPH-MCP">Health &amp; Social Behavior (MPH-MCP)</a></h5>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-30e17cfb-7fff-055a-409f-00c6f5c7f119">This concurrent degree program is designed to examine research, practice, and policy at the intersection of urban planning, policy and design with population health. Special attention is given to understanding the forces that are shaping urbanization in the US and globally, what methods are necessary to analyze the relationships between urban policy and planning and human health, and to design and analyze interventions, frequently in partnership with community members and organizations, that can enhance urban health equity. The program prepares students for interdisciplinary careers in such fields as urban development, community health, housing, transportation, policymaking, and others. Graduates secure jobs working in government, international organizations, non-profits, academia/research and the private sector.</span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-30e17cfb-7fff-055a-409f-00c6f5c7f119">Candidates for this program are recruited and admitted through both the School of Public Health and the Department of City and Regional Planning. Students complete the core curriculum of each area, as well as the Health &amp; Social Behavior track within MPH and an area of concentration in MCP. Visit the </span><a href="https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/city-regional-planning/programs/concurrent-programs/public-health/">City and Regional Planning website</a> for more information.</p>
<p><a id="Public Health Journalism MPH-MJ" name="Public Health Journalism MPH-MJ">Public Health and Journalism (MPH-MJ)</a></p>
<p class="text-intro">The three-year MPH/MJ allows students to combine their interests in public health, journalism, communications and media. The program is designed to produce public health professionals who are effective media practitioners and communicators as well as journalists with the training and knowledge necessary to cover public health and medical issues for online, print, broadcast and other media platforms.</p>
<p>Students select one of four public health concentrations (environmental health, infectious diseases, epidemiology/biostatistics, health and social behavior) and simultaneously develop their reporting and multimedia skills. The program explores how public health and journalism intersect and impact each other and prepares graduates for work in a variety of public health, media and journalism. Visit the <a href="https://journalism.berkeley.edu/programs/concurrent-degree/">Berkeley Journalism website</a><span> for more information</span><span>. </span></p>
<h5><a id="Health Policy Management MPH-MBA" name="Health Policy Management MPH-MBA"><span>Health Policy &amp; Management (MPH-MBA)</span></a></h5>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-09a63cf9-7fff-5a53-9c1a-155167faef55">The MBA/MPH program provides a deep competency in business administration, integrated with up-to-the-minute knowledge of health policy and management and other health care concepts. Students in this program pursue a wide range of interests including global health, entrepreneurship/start-ups, biotech/medtech, provider and payer initiatives, and social impact. This track allows students to have an extended period at Berkeley to take more electives, develop business and leadership skills in a range of applied health care settings, and have two distinct full-time summer internships.</span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-09a63cf9-7fff-5a53-9c1a-155167faef55">This is a 2.5-year concurrent degree program, offered in a long-standing partnership between Berkeley Public Health and the Haas School of Business. It has been in existence for more than 35 years, so it has a large community of alumni and provides students access to the top-notch career services and faculty mentors from both Schools. </span><span id="docs-internal-guid-cb68c1e4-7fff-fdab-8a92-c62d6be1042e">Visit the </span><a href="https://mba.haas.berkeley.edu/academics/concurrent-degree-programs">Haas School of Business</a> webpage for the MBA requirements.</p>

This is an interdisciplinary course which will adopt a broad-based ecological perspective of health and behavior. This class will emphasize the interconnected and multidirectional relationships between biology, behavior, and the social environment. This course will be conducted as a seminar series (with a focus on biological processes). We will investigate the assertion that biological, psychological, and social processes interact over a lifetime</span><span class="deschide"> to influence health and vulnerability to disease (a developmental epigenetic perspective). Rather than focusing on &quot;if&quot; social factors can influence health and disease we will focus on &quot;how&quot; social factors may regulate/change biological measures. Three very general themes will be addressed: development, &quot;social&quot; neuroscience and gene-environment interactions as they relate to behavior. Topics such as constraints/plasticity and behavior, genetic determinism, vulnerability versus resilience, gene-environment interactions, fetal/developmental programming, and stress will all be touched upon.</span><br/>

This course serves as an introduction to key topics in health policy making in the United States, with a focus on the policy process and policy analysis methods. Using the policy analysis framework of Eugene Bardach’s Eightfold Path first introduced in PBHLTH W200E, the course will explore the entire policy analysis process from the identification of a problem, to the evaluation of policy solutions, and finally to the techniques</span><span class="deschide"> and formats for effective health policy communications. This analysis method is contextualized within the process of public policy making within the U.S. government.</span><br/>

In this class, we will construct a framework to formulate explanations for health care disparities and to construct responses that have the potential for a policy-oriented, and therefore widespread, response. Taking advantage of selected developments in social science theory and research that can provide insight into how health care disparities come about, we will draw from anthropological and psychological theories of cultural orientation</span><span class="deschide">, cultural framing of problems, and cultural identity; as well as drawing from psychological theories of stress and coping. We also will draw from sociological theories of individual and community poverty, and theories characterizing health care system design and service delivery.</span><br/>

With the ongoing “data explosion”, methods to delineate causation from correlation are perhaps more pressing now than ever. This course will introduce a general framework for Causal Inference in Public Health: 1) clear statement of the research question, 2) definition of the causal model and effect of interest, 3) assessment of identifiability, 4) choice and implementation of estimators including parametric and non-parametric methods, and 5) appropriate interpretation</span><span class="deschide"> of findings. The statistical methods include G-computation, inverse probability weighting (IPW), and targeted minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE) with machine learning.</span><br/>

This doctoral seminar is designed to provide an understanding of the complex (and often interactive) individual and environmental conditions that increase the risk of psychopathology in individuals across the life span. We will start by learning about general concepts important to an understanding of psychopathology and prevention of psychopathology, including the &quot;biopsychosocial model,&quot; &quot;psychological resilence,&quot; and different</span><span class="deschide"> levels of preventive interventions. For each different area of psychopathology, we will consider: a) the core feature of disorder; b) key theory and empirical evidence regarding etiology and course, with a particular emphasis on understanding the range of risk and protective factors on the individual, family, and community level; and c) the implications of etiological understanding for public health efforts to prevent the particular disorder.</span><br/>

This course is designed to review, evaluate, and apply methods currently used in the field of social epidemiology. The course aims to teach approaches to forming clear research questions, and selecting the best method(s) to answer the questions posed. Initially we will discuss approaches to defining clear and specific research questions. We will then discuss recent controversies around the meaning of questions posed in social epidemiology, and</span><span class="deschide"> the ability of currently used methods to answer questions in social epidemiology. Finally we will review, evaluate, and apply a range of different methods that are or could be used to answer questions in social epidemiology, again emphasizing the types of questions answered by these methods, and their ability to address the challenges to effectively answering questions in social epidemiology. There will be a mixture of discussion and lecture depending on the topic, with student participation and questions strongly encouraged.</span><br/>

This course will be the principal immunology course for students in the field of public health. It is designed to teach both the basic biology of the human immune system and its response in health and disease, especially the specific response of the human immune system to major human pathogens. Four areas will be explored: 1) components of the immune system (spectrum of cell types and cell products); 2) different arms of the immune system including</span><span class="deschide"> humoral, cell-mediated, innate, and mucosal immunity; 3) specific immune response to infection caused by viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic pathogens; and 4) disorders of the immune system unrelated to infectious disease. Through this course, students should not only gain a basic understanding of the human immune system, but also learn the functions and responses of the human immune system to diseases of infectious and non-infectious nature, and the relevance of these interactions in the context of public health problems.</span><br/>

Homelessness is an epidemic in the United States affecting more than 500,000 people each day. It impacts people of all races, age, and family situations, and it has enormous consequences for physical and mental health. There is no single cause, and no single solution. The focus of this course is the relationship between homelessness and health. We will discuss the range of causes for homelessness and how each of these is correlated to individual health, public health</span><span class="deschide">, public policy, and the law. We will explore various strategies and approaches through readings, guest lecturers, and student-led discussions.<br/></span><br/>

Scientific knowledge and analyses are important to the development of public policies that address the impact of the environment on health. The limits of existing knowledge and uncertainties in research results create significant challenges in applying science to answer critical questions. This course critically examines how scientific information is used in policy decisions. Case studies of current issues address characterization of scientific</span><span class="deschide"> knowledge, interpretation of science in policy contexts, scientific integrity, and factors in addition to science that influence decisions. Assignments prepare students to effectively translate technical knowledge for multi-disciplinary and lay audiences and to participate in public policy proceedings. Core materials address differences between regulatory and market-based approaches; emerging paradigms including the precautionary principle and environmental justice; and key elements of risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis.</span><br/>

Geographic information systems (GIS) have emerged as an important tool for performing health and environmental analyses. GIS is generally seen as a spatial analysis system for the organization, storage, retrieval, and analysis of data for which the location and other spatial attributes are considered important (e.g., incidence of a specific disease condition in relation to a pollution source). GIS also encompasses the organizational structure</span><span class="deschide">, personnel, software, and hardware needed to support spatial analysis. For many health and social scientists, GIS has evolved into a new lens for viewing their work. The course will provide students with an introduction to this exciting and expanding field of inquiry. On successful completion of the course you should possess the following skills and knowledge: 1) A basic understanding of the fundamental geographic and cartographic concepts that underlie GIS. 2) Working knowledge of ArcGIS, a powerful &quot;desktop&quot; GIS software package that runs in a Windows environment. 3) Introductory knowledge of past, present, and possible future applications of GIS for health and environmental studies.</span><br/>

Students will acquire geospatial skills and apply them in the context of structural inequity, health disparities, and racial justice. Geospatial skills will be applied to public health problems that continue to demonstrate differences in health exposures, risks, and adverse outcomes for BIPOC living in the US, as well as to contribute to much poorer outcomes in the US than in other high income countries. The main learning objective in the course is to understand the</span><span class="deschide"> importance of place in the display, analysis, and reporting of health data at local, national, and global scales. Each week, case studies will provide context for the specific ways in which place matters when thinking about public health and health services delivery.</span><br/>

Injuries are a major and often neglected health problem with substantial human and economic costs. Injuries are the leading cause of death from the first year of life to age 45, and the leading cause of lost potential years of life. This course provides an historical and conceptual framework within which to consider injuries (both intentional and unintentional) as social, and public health problems. Through review of epidemiology and intervention</span><span class="deschide"> studies, course work will consider the causes and consequences of traumatic injury within developmental, social and economic contexts. Particular emphasis is placed on alternative strategies for injury prevention and on the relative benefits of intervention at different levels.</span><br/>

				<a name="aboutthecertificatetext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-e28a44ec-7fff-7ee5-5ec0-f0343923c181">The Graduate Certificate in Applied Data Science, offered by the UC Berkeley School of Information, introduces the tools, methods, and conceptual approaches used to support modern data analysis and decision-making in professional and applied research settings. It exposes students to the challenges of working with data (e.g., asking a good question, inference and causality, decision-making) as well as to the new tools and techniques for data analytics (machine learning, data mining, and more).</span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-e28a44ec-7fff-7ee5-5ec0-f0343923c181">The certificate is particularly designed to meet the needs of the graduate students in Berkeley’s professional schools — both professional master’s students and doctoral students — as well as graduate students in the social sciences and the arts &amp; humanities.</span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-e28a44ec-7fff-7ee5-5ec0-f0343923c181">The need for expertise in data analytics continues to grow in all organizations and disciplines. Graduate students in every field are now working with data from new sources: websites, electronic medical records, transaction records, sensor networks, smart phones, and digitized records and documents. The analytical tools and methods traditionally used to derive insights from structured and well-curated data sets (census, surveys, and administrative data) are not sufficient for this new, unstructured and often user-generated data.</span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-e28a44ec-7fff-7ee5-5ec0-f0343923c181">The Graduate Certificate in Applied Data Science provides hands-on practice working with unstructured and user-generated data to identify new ways to inform decision-making. The curriculum educates professionals and scholars to be intelligent consumers of data science techniques in a variety of domains, with a foundation of skills for applying these techniques in their own domains.</span></p>

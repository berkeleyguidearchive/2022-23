<h4>About the Energy and Resources Group</h4>
<p>The Energy and Resources Group is a col­lab­o­ra­tive com­mu­nity of grad­u­ate stu­dents, core fac­ulty, 200 affil­i­ated fac­ulty and researchers across the cam­pus, and more than 600 alumni across the globe. The Energy and Resources Group provides advanced training in interdisciplinary analysis and research with the goal of creating transformative knowledge for the planet and its people.</p>
<p>As one of the first interdisciplinary programs in the field, Energy and Resources faculty and students have established an impressive track record of undertaking engaged, cutting-edge research and turning these ideas into effective actions from local to global levels.</p>
<p>Courses cover current developments in the field and emphasize a variety of disciplinary perspectives and methodologies: core areas include economics, social sciences, engineering, humanities, and environmental sciences.</p>
<h4><strong>Ph.D. in Energy and Resources</strong></h4>
<p>The Energy and Resources Group admits highly qualified applicants into the Ph.D. program, designed to support and empower doctoral students to pursue rigorous, interdisciplinary, and original research in the fields of energy, resources, and the environment. The Ph.D. Degree in Energy and Resources is typically completed four years beyond the Master’s Degree.</p>
<h4><strong>Master’s Degrees in Energy and Resources (M.A. or M.S.)</strong></h4>
<p>The Energy and Resources Master’s Degree is a two-year program designed to educate the next generation of interdisciplinary leaders. The curriculum is intended to serve those students for whom the Master’s Degree will be the final formal education in support of a professional career. It also serves as an interdisciplinary foundation for doctoral students preparing for dissertation research.</p>
<p>Students are taught the range of methods and subjects that they should be able to understand, advance, and critique, in order to address critical challenges stemming from the interaction of humans and the environment. To that end, the requirements for the Energy and Resources Master’s Degree are both broad and deep, stressing analytic, theoretical, and practical approaches to problems in energy, resources, and the environment.</p>
<p>The course requirements provide for a substantive introduction to the disciplinary approaches that are employed in studying energy and resource issues. These approaches are codified as the A-F Breadth Requirements. For more detail on the A-F requirements please go to <a href="https://erg.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">https://erg.berkeley.edu/</a></p>
<p>The program also ensures experience in interdisciplinary analysis applied to key resource concerns. The curriculum provides an opportunity, through a topical course cluster and an independent capstone project, to extend and deepen the areas of investigation and understanding to satisfy the intellectual interests of each student.</p>
<h4><strong>Concurrent Master's Degree of Public Policy and Energy and Resources </strong></h4>
<p>The Energy and Resources Group and The Goldman School of Public Policy offer a three-year concurrent Master's Degree program that integrates the strengths of public policy analytical tools with the interdisciplinary knowledge and expertise in energy and resources.</p>
<h4><strong>Undergraduate Minor in Energy and Resources</strong></h4>
<p>The ERG Minor offers knowl­edge and skills to enable students to address the com­plex and inter­de­pen­dent issues asso­ci­ated with the inter­ac­tion of social, eco­nomic, polit­i­cal, tech­ni­cal, and envi­ron­men­tal fac­tors. Stu­dents in any major may add the ERG minor, which is composed of two core and three elective upper division courses. Several of these courses have prerequisites in mathematics or science.</p>
<h4><strong>Undergraduate Summer Minor / Certificate in Sustainability </strong></h4>
<p>This summer program offers a practical and relevant interdisciplinary approach at the intersection of environmental, economic, social, political, and cultural issues. It is open to matriculated UC Berkeley undergraduates, students from other institutions, and the general public. Upon completion, UC Berkeley undergraduates receive a Minor in Sustainability, while other participants receive a Certificate in Sustainability from UC Berkeley.</p>

<![CDATA[
<h3><strong>Admission to the University</strong></h3>
 <h4>Minimum Requirements for Admission</h4> <p>The following minimum requirements apply to all graduate programs and will be verified by the Graduate Division:</p> <ol> 	<li>A bachelor’s degree or recognized equivalent from an accredited institution;</li> 	<li>A grade point average of B or better (3.0);</li> 	<li>If the applicant has completed a basic degree from a country or political entity (e.g., Quebec) where English is not the official language, adequate proficiency in English to do graduate work, as evidenced by a TOEFL score of at least 90 on the iBT test, 570 on the paper-and-pencil test, or an IELTS Band score of at least 7 on a 9-point scale (note that individual programs may set higher levels for any of these); and</li> 	<li>Sufficient undergraduate training to do graduate work in the given field.</li> </ol> <h4>Applicants Who Already Hold a Graduate Degree</h4> <p>The Graduate Council views academic degrees not as vocational training certificates, but as evidence of broad training in research methods, independent study, and articulation of learning. Therefore, applicants who already have academic graduate degrees should be able to pursue new subject matter at an advanced level without the need to enroll in a related or similar graduate program.</p> <p>Programs may consider students for an additional academic master’s or professional master’s degree only if the additional degree is in a distinctly different field.</p> <p>Applicants admitted to a doctoral program that requires a master’s degree to be earned at Berkeley as a prerequisite (even though the applicant already has a master’s degree from another institution in the same or a closely allied field of study) will be permitted to undertake the second master’s degree, despite the overlap in field.</p> <p>The Graduate Division will admit students for a second doctoral degree only if they meet the following guidelines:</p> <ol> 	<li>Applicants with doctoral degrees may be admitted for an additional doctoral degree only if that degree program is in a general area of knowledge distinctly different from the field in which they earned their original degree. For example, a physics PhD could be admitted to a doctoral degree program in music or history; however, a student with a doctoral degree in mathematics would not be permitted to add a PhD in statistics.</li> 	<li>Applicants who hold the PhD degree may be admitted to a professional doctorate or professional master’s degree program if there is no duplication of training involved.</li> </ol> <p>Applicants may apply only to one single degree program or one concurrent degree program per admission cycle.</p> <h4>Required Documents for Applications</h4> <ol> 	<li><strong>Transcripts: </strong>Applicants may upload <em>unofficial </em>transcripts with your application for the departmental initial review. Unofficial transcripts must contain specific information including the name of the applicant, name of the school, all courses, grades, units, &amp; degree conferral (if applicable). </li> 	<li><strong>Letters of recommendation:</strong> Applicants may request online letters of recommendation through the online application system. Hard copies of recommendation letters must be sent directly to the program, by the recommender, not the Graduate Admissions.</li> 	<li> 	<p><strong><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">Evidence of English language proficiency:</span> </strong>All applicants who have completed a basic degree from a country or political entity in which the official language is not English are required to submit official evidence of English language proficiency. This applies to institutions from Bangladesh, Burma, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Latin America, the Middle East, the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, most European countries, and Quebec (Canada). However, applicants who, at the time of application, have already completed at least one year of full-time academic course work with grades of B or better at a US university may submit an official transcript from the US university to fulfill this requirement. The following courses will not fulfill this requirement:</p> 	<ul> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses in English as a Second Language,</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses conducted in a language other than English,</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses that will be completed after the application is submitted, and</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses of a non-academic nature.</span></p> 		</li> 	</ul> 	</li> </ol> <p style="margin-left:30pt"><span><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">Applicants who have previously applied to Berkeley must also submit new test scores that meet the current minimum requirement from one of the standardized tests. Official TOEFL score reports must be sent directly from Educational Test Services (ETS). The institution code for Berkeley is 4833 for Graduate Organizations. Official IELTS score reports must be sent electronically from the testing center to University of California, Berkeley, Graduate Division, Sproul Hall, Rm 318 MC 5900, Berkeley, CA 94720. TOEFL and IELTS score reports are only valid for two years prior to beginning the graduate program at UC Berkeley. </span></span>Note: score reports can not expire before the month of June.</p> <div> </div> <h4>Where to Apply</h4> <p>Visit the Berkeley Graduate Division <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply/" target="_blank">application page</a>. </p>
<h3><strong>Admission to the Program</strong></h3>
<p>The Energy and Resources Group seeks students who have excelled academically, whatever their discipline; who show promise of ability to cross disciplinary boundaries; and who want not only to understand problems of energy, resources, and environment but to help solve them. ERG deliberately admits students with a wide variety of interests, perspectives, disciplines, research methods, and experience so that each can help the others see the whole picture.</p>
<p>Admission to ERG is highly competitive, with a class of approximately 20 students (Master’s and Ph.D. combined) selected annually from approximately 300 applicants. Those admitted to the program have strong academic records and letters of recommendation, balanced and strong GRE scores, and, where applicable, related work experience and publications. The statement of purpose, supplemented by the personal history statement, is vital in demonstrating an applicant’s commitment to the program.</p>
<p>You may apply to the two-year Master’s Degree (M.S. or M.A.), three-year ERG/Public Policy Concurrent Master’s Degree, or the Ph.D. program.</p>
<h5>Equity, Inclusion and Diversity at ERG</h5>
<p>At ERG, we believe that diversity drives innovative research and discovery, expands our capacity for teaching and learning, and prepares our graduate students to be effective leaders in the transition towards a more sustainable environment and a just society. To learn how ERG actively promotes intellectual, racial, ethnic, and gender inclusion, visit our <a href="https://erg.berkeley.edu/about/diversity/">Equity, Inclusion, &amp; Diversity</a> page.</p>
<h5><strong>Admission to the Master's Program, M.A. or M.S.</strong></h5>
<p>The minimum requirement for admission to the master’s degree program is completion of a Bachelor’s Degree or its equivalent at a fully accredited US institution of higher learning or international equivalent. Because the program is fundamentally interdisciplinary, there are no other formal requirements for consideration, although, as discussed above, successful candidates will demonstrate academic and intellectual excellence.</p>
<h5><strong>Admission to the Ph.D. Program</strong></h5>
<p>The first two years of the Ph.D. involve coursework, taught jointly with the Master’s Degree students, and a Final Project in the second year. Please see the <a href="https://erg.berkeley.edu/academics/program/masters-degree-curriculum-requirements/">Master’s Degree Curriculum</a> for further details. Doctoral students will receive a Master of Science or Master of Arts Degree in Energy and Resources upon completion of the first two years’ requirements.</p>
<p>In some cases for highly qualified students, ERG may waive some course or project requirements for Ph.D. students who already hold a Master’s Degree and who can demonstrate a strong interdisciplinary academic background.</p>
<h5><strong>Recommended Preparation</strong></h5>
<p>We recommend at least one term of college-level calculus, courses in fundamental science (e.g., physics, chemistry, and biology), as well as <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/graduate/degree-programs/energy-resources/#_msocom_1" id="_anchor_1" name="_msoanchor_1">[1]</a> upper division social science (for example political science, sociology, or anthropology) and humanities courses.</p>

<h4>Energy and Resources Ph.D.</h4>
<p>The primary focus of the Ph.D. is the research and writing of the student's dissertation. After satisfying the first two years’ course requirements, Ph.D. students will prepare for their Qualifying Examination and commence their Dissertation research.</p>
<h5>Coursework</h5>
<p>In most cases, entering Ph.D. students complete the ERG Master's Degree during their first two years. Please see the <a href="https://erg.berkeley.edu/academics/program/masters-degree-curriculum-requirements/">Master’s Degree Curriculum</a> for further details. This is designed to ensure doctoral students possess sufficient breadth and foundational knowledge to begin their original research. </p>
<p>After completion of the Energy and Resources Master's Degree, Ph.D. students prepare for their Qualifying Examination and commence their dissertation research.</p>
<p>Faculty advisors, at their discretion, may waive some course or project requirements for Ph.D. students who have sufficient academic preparation. If an admitted Ph.D. student previously has completed a two-year Master's Degree in a program closely equivalent to the Energy and Resources Master's Degree, they may begin preparing immediately for their qualifying examination and dissertation research. In these cases, any additional coursework required to support the student's  research plan will be identified in consultation with the student's primary faculty advisor.</p>
<h5>Qualifying Exam</h5>
<p>When the doctoral student and his or her faculty advisors have agreed on a subject for the dissertation, the student must defend in a three-hour oral examination the suitability of the topic and his/her preparation for conducting original research in it. This Qualifying Examination is conducted by a committee of four faculty members chosen by the student, in consultation with his/her faculty advisor and subject to the approval of the Graduate Dean.</p>
<h5>Dissertation</h5>
<p>The final requirement for the Ph.D. is the completion of the dissertation to the satisfaction of a committee consisting of three faculty advisors chosen by the student, subject to approval by the Graduate Dean. The Ph.D. degree in Energy and Resources is typically completed four years beyond the Master’s Degree.</p>

<mastersdegreerequirementsmstext name="Master's Degree Requirements">
<![CDATA[
<p>The course requirements provide for a substantive introduction to the disciplinary approaches that are employed in studying energy and resource issues. The requirements also ensure experience in interdisciplinary analysis applied to a key resource concern. The curriculum provides an opportunity — through a topical cluster and an independent project — to extend and deepen the areas of investigation and understanding to satisfy the intellectual interests of each student.</p>
<p>The curriculum is intended to serve those students for whom the Master’s degree will be the final formal education in support of a professional career and also those students who intend to continue their education, for example by pursuing a PhD in Energy and Resources.</p>
<p>To obtain a Master’s degree from ERG, each student must meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Complete a minimum of 40 post-baccalaureate units.</li>
	<li>Complete a minimum of 18 units of graduate-level study in energy and resources, many of which can be fulfilled by courses from other departments and schools.</li>
	<li>Complete the ERG Masters Degree Series:
	<ul>
		<li><span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="ENE,RES 293A">ENE,RES 293A</span></span> – Interdisciplinary Analysis in Energy and Resources (3 units)</li>
		<li><span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="ENE,RES 293B">ENE,RES 293B</span></span> – Master’s Research Skills and Project Development (2 units)</li>
		<li><span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="ENE,RES 293C">ENE,RES 293C</span></span> – Masters Project Development (2 units)</li>
		<li><span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="ENE,RES 293D">ENE,RES 293D</span></span> – Masters Project Presentation (2 units)</li>
		<li><span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="ENE,RES 295">ENE,RES 295</span></span> – ERG Colloquium (2 units) Two semesters are required to ensure exposure to a broad array of topics and approaches.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The following limits and restrictions apply on credit toward the 40-unit requirement:</li>
	<li>A maximum of 4 units of 299 (individual research) credits can be counted.</li>
	<li>298  units (group study) cannot be counted.</li>
</ul>
<p>To ensure effective early planning and consultation, ERG Master’s students are expected to submit a completed “Proposed Course of Study” form by the last day of class in their first  semester. This form will indicate the courses that the student intends to take to meet the requirements given above. It will be completed by the student in consultation with the student’s ERG core faculty advisor.  The course of study may change as a student’s interests and plans change. At the end of the second and third semesters, students are expected to submit a revised course of study.  The final course of study must be approved early in the student’s final semester to meet the requirements for graduation.</p>
<p>At the end of the third semester, students also are required to submit their proposed Master’s Project title and abstract to their ERG core faculty advisor, who will provide feedback. Each student, in collaboration with the first faculty reader and the instructor(s) of the Master’s seminar, will prepare a proposed project title and abstract for the Master’s project by the end of the student’s third semester.</p>
<p>The ERG Master’s program can lead to either an MA or MS degree in Energy and Resources. In consultation with the advisor, each student makes a request of the MA or MS degree <em>based on the substantive content of coursework and Master’s project. </em>The ERG core faculty advisor makes a final determination of the appropriateness of the MA/MS selection.</p>
<h3>Area (A-F) requirement</h3>
<p>Teaching and research in the Energy and Resources Group draws heavily on five academic traditions, as they are applied to the interactions of societies with resources and the natural environment. The ERG Master’s curriculum ensures that each student is well acquainted with each of these academic spheres and also experiences how distinct approaches from these intellectual traditions are brought to bear in interdisciplinary resource analysis. Consequently, one of the cornerstone requirements of the ERG Master’s curriculum is the A-F requirements.</p>
<p><strong>A. Interdisciplinary analysis<br/>
B. Environmental science<br/>
C. Resource and environmental economics<br/>
D. Social science approaches to energy, resources and the environment<br/>
E. Engineering approaches to energy, resources and the environment<br/>
F. Humanities</strong></p>
<p>Selecting Coursework</p>
<p>All Master’s Degree students are required to complete Area A (Interdisciplinary Analysis) plus courses in four of the five areas B – F. Students select four areas in consultation with their ERG Core Faculty Academic Adviser. Students must choose to take the area, or at least one of the areas, of greatest deficiency in their academic or professional record. If there is more than one area gap in the student’s record, the student and their adviser will come to an agreement about which four areas will fulfill ERG requirements.</p>
<p>The Berkeley Academic Guide catalog is always evolving, and not all courses are offered every term. Therefore alternate courses to those listed in the B-F Course List are allowed with permission of the designated responsible faculty.</p>
<p>The alternate course must meet the intent and prerequisites of the area requirement. Attributes that would normally be considered minimum requirements for an alternative course to be acceptable are these: 3+ units, taken for a letter grade, lecture or laboratory-based instruction (i.e., no seminar courses) with substantive intellectual content and topical relevance to the academic tradition of ERG. The purpose of these courses is to provide ERG students sufficient background in the physical and social constructions of the relevant systems to enable them to understand key issues and to begin to conduct research in that area.</p>
<p><strong>A. Interdisciplinary Energy and Resource Analysis<br/>
Responsible Faculty: Daniel Kammen</strong></p>
<p>The following courses satisfy this requirement:</p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="ENE,RES C200">ENE,RES C200</span></span> – Energy and Society (Prerequisite: at least one course in college physics or chemistry)<br/>
	<span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="ENE,RES 275">ENE,RES 275</span></span> – Water and Development (Prerequisite: at least one college-level development-focused or water-focused course)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B. Environmental Science<br/>
Responsible Faculty: Lara Kueppers</strong></p>
<p>The ERG environmental science requirement teaches the analytical methods and the fundamental principles needed to understand and creatively engage with the biotic and abiotic environment. Topical content spans physics, biology, chemistry, and mathematics, with a focus on the cross-boundary subfields of biodiversity science, biogeochemistry, climatology, hydrology, toxicology, radiation and radioactivity, and demography. An emphasis is placed on developing the capacity to construct and use back-of-the-large-envelope modeling methods. We do not count courses that focus in on subsets of the above subfields, but you can make a case for substituting collections of courses for the core ERG course (ER 102), provided those courses emphasize quantitative tools comparable to those taught in ER 102.</p>

<p><strong>C. Resource and Environmental Economics<br/>
Responsible Faculty: David Anthoff</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the economics requirement is for students to become acquainted with the tools and analytical methods used in economics. For students that have never taken an intermediate microeconomics course before, this requirement can only be fulfilled by an intermediate microeconomics course.

<p><strong>D. Social Science Approaches to Energy, Resources and the Environment<br/>
Responsible Faculty: Isha Ray</strong></p>
<p>The ERG social science requirement aims to make students “see” the social world through methods and theories common to traditional social science fields such as: geography, political science, anthropology, sociology, and critical planning approaches. All classes should be 3 units, contain significant social science readings, but not be directed reading seminars. These courses generally have as prerequisites undergraduate level courses in geography, sociology, anthropology or political science.</p>
<p>Some of the courses that satisfy this requirement:</p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="ENE,RES 273">ENE,RES 273</span></span> – Research Methods in Social Sciences</li>

<p><strong>E. Engineering Approaches to Energy, Resources and the Environment<br/>
Responsible Faculty: Duncan Callaway</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this area is to provide all ERG students with exposure to and experience with the problem-solving, design-oriented approach of relevant engineering disciplines. Other courses may be allowed by petition, but must have substantive engineering content and topical relevance to the domain of ERG, and must be offered in the College of Engineering or in the Department of Chemical Engineering. Note: These courses will have various prerequisites.</p>
<p>Some of the courses that satisfy this requirement:</p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="ENE,RES 254">ENE,RES 254</span></span> – Electric Power Systems</li>

</ul>
<p>F. Environmental Humanities<br/>
Responsible Faculty: Isha Ray</p>
<p>Humanities courses introduce students to historical, philosophical, textual, and interpretive methodologies and epistemologies, which are distinct from the mainstream methods taught or used within the social sciences. The humanities deal with history, philosophy, languages, religion, literature and even art — with what makes us human. Conversely, the social sciences deal with sociology, anthropology, politics, economics, urban planning — with what makes us social.</p>
<p>Some of the courses that satisfy this requirement:</p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="sc_courseinline"><span class="code_bubble" data-code-bubble="ESPM 161">ESPM 161</span></span> – Environmental Philosophy and Ethics</li>

This course is a self-contained introduction to the economics of climate change. Climate change is caused by a large variety of economic activities, and many of its impacts will have economic consequences. Economists have studied climate change for more than two decades, and economic arguments are often powerful in policy decisions. The course will familiarize students with these arguments and equip them with the tools to participate</span><span class="deschide"> in discussions of climate change policy through an economic lens.</span><br/>

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> The course will start with a brief review of the science of climate change, discuss scenarios of economic growth and the greenhouse gas emissions caused by economic activities and investigate various emission reduction opportunities and their economic costs. A significant amount of time will be spent on studying the impacts of climate change, their economic evaluation and how adaptation can lower the costs of climate damages.<br/>
<br/>We will then study various theoretical frameworks economists have developed that answer the question how estimates about the costs and benefits of climate policy can be combined to find “good” climate policies. We then study three more specialized topics that turn out to be of great importance when analyzing climate change policy: first, how do we compare costs and benefits of generations that live many centuries apart? Second, how do we design climate policy when our projections of both the costs and the benefits of climate policy are highly uncertain? And third, how can equity considerations be accounted for in an economic assessment of climate change policy? The course will close with a look at international cooperation on climate policy and why it has been so difficult to agree on effective treatises that implement climate change policy.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Students will also have gained insight into the practical aspects of modeling the economics of climate change by building a simple integrated assessment model in Excel. They will be able to use that model to do simple analysis of climate change policy themselves.<br/>
Students will be familiar with the tools economists use to analyze climate change policy. They will have studied empirical estimates of the costs and benefits of climate policy and have an understanding of the analytical issues that drive research on the economics of climate change.</p></div>

Economists through history have explored economic and environmental interactions, physical limits to growth, what constitutes the good life, and how economic justice can be assured. Yet economists continue to use measures and models that simplify these issues and promote bad outcomes.

As the climate crisis escalates and mitigation efforts stagnate, adaptation has come to the forefront of public debates and funding priorities. This course will explore the varied political ecologies of climate change adaptation. By drawing on political ecology, this course will include both foundational and emerging scholarship that explores how climate change adaptation is shaping and being shaped by the material impacts of climate change, the political economy of</span><span class="deschide"> climate governance and finance, and the agency of experts, funders, promoters, and the individuals and collectives adapting to climate change.

This class is an interdisciplinary graduate seminar for students of water policy in developing countries. It is not a seminar on theories and practices of development through the &quot;lens&quot; of water. Rather, it is a seminar motivated by the fact that over 1 billion people in developing countries have no access to safe drinking water, 3 billion don't have sanitation facilities and many millions of small farmers do not have reliable water</span><span class="deschide"> supplies to ensure a healthy crop. Readings and discussions will cover: the problems of water access and use in developing countries; the potential for technological, social, and economic solutions to these problems; the role of institutions in access to water and sanitation; and the pitfalls of and assumptions behind some of today's popular &quot;solutions.&quot;</span><br/>

This course is a self-contained introduction to the economics of climate change. Climate change is caused by a large variety of economic activities, and many of its impacts will have economic consequences. Economists have studied climate change for more than two decades, and economic arguments are often powerful in policy decisions. The course will familiarize students with these arguments and equip them with the tools to participate in discussions</span><span class="deschide"> of climate change policy through an economic lens.</span><br/>

<div id="366" class="coursedetails" aria-expanded="false">
<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> The course will start with a brief review of the science of climate change, discuss scenarios of economic growth and the greenhouse gas emissions caused by economic activities and investigate various emission reduction opportunities and their economic costs. A significant amount of time will be spent on studying the impacts of climate change, their economic evaluation and how adaptation can lower the costs of climate damages.<br/>We will then study various theoretical frameworks economists have developed that answer the question how estimates about the costs and benefits of climate policy can be combined to find “good” climate policies. We then study three more specialized topics that turn out to be of great importance when analyzing climate change policy: first, how do we compare costs and benefits of generations that live many centuries apart? Second, how do we design climate policy when our projections of both the costs and the benefits of climate policy are highly uncertain? And third, how can equity considerations be accounted for in an economic assessment of climate change policy? The course will close with a look at international cooperation on climate policy and why it has been so difficult to agree on effective treatises that implement climate change policy.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Students will also have gained insight into the practical aspects of modeling the economics of climate change by building a simple integrated assessment model in a scientific programming language of their choice. They will be able to use that model to do simple analysis of climate change policy themselves.<br/>
Students will be familiar with the tools economists use to analyze climate change policy. They will have studied empirical estimates of the costs and benefits of climate policy and have an understanding of the analytical issues that drive research on the economics of climate change.</p></div>

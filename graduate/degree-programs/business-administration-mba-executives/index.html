				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p class="Normal1">The Berkeley MBA for Executives Program is a unique learning experience because of how — not simply what — you learn. You will integrate your intellectual talents and industry experience and apply your classroom and experiential learning to actual business situations in unprecedented ways. Although the program is competitive and challenging (it offers the same rigorous degree as our Full Time and Evening &amp; Weekend MBA programs) it is also intensely collaborative, making the often repeated statement that you learn as much from your peers as from your professors more than a truism.</p>
<p class="Normal1">Our Executive MBA program focuses on applying knowledge and skills to challenges that leaders face in today's workplace. As an accomplished professional seeking a highly relevant learning experience, you will find that your studies and classroom discussions have a direct bearing on choices you are making for your organization.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://mbaforexecs.haas.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit School Website</a></p>

				<a name="admissionstext"></a><h2>Admissions</h2><p>Please see departmental website at <a href="http://mbaforexecs.haas.berkeley.edu/">http://mbaforexecs.haas.berkeley.edu/</a></p>
<h3>Admission to the University</h3>
<h4>Minimum Requirements for Admission</h4>
<p>The following minimum requirements apply to all graduate programs and will be verified by the Graduate Division:</p>
<ol>
	<li>A bachelor’s degree or recognized equivalent from an accredited institution;</li>
	<li>A grade point average of B or better (3.0);</li>
	<li>If the applicant comes from a country or political entity (e.g., Quebec) where English is not the official language, adequate proficiency in English to do graduate work, as evidenced by a TOEFL score of at least 90 on the iBT test, or an IELTS Band score of at least 7 (note that individual programs may set higher levels for any of these); and</li>
	<li>Sufficient undergraduate training to do graduate work in the given field.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Applicants Who Already Hold a Graduate Degree</h4>
<p>The Graduate Council views academic degrees not as vocational training certificates but as evidence of broad training in research methods, independent study, and articulation of learning. Therefore, applicants who already have academic graduate degrees should be able to pursue new subject matter at an advanced level without need to enroll in a related or similar graduate program.</p>
<p>Programs may consider students for an additional academic master’s or professional master’s degree only if the additional degree is in a distinctly different field.</p>
<p>Applicants admitted to a doctoral program that requires a master’s degree to be earned at Berkeley as a prerequisite (even though the applicant already has a master’s degree from another institution in the same or a closely allied field of study) will be permitted to undertake the second master’s degree, despite the overlap in field.</p>
<p>The Graduate Division will admit students for a second doctoral degree only if they meet the following guidelines:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Applicants with doctoral degrees may be admitted for an additional doctoral degree only if that degree program is in a general area of knowledge distinctly different from the field in which they earned their original degree. For example, a physics PhD could be admitted to a doctoral degree program in music or history; however, a student with a doctoral degree in mathematics would not be permitted to add a PhD in statistics.</li>
	<li>Applicants who hold the PhD degree may be admitted to a professional doctorate or professional master’s degree program if there is no duplication of training involved.</li>
</ol>
<p>Applicants may apply only to one single degree program or one concurrent degree program per admission cycle.</p>
<p>Any applicant who was previously registered at Berkeley as a graduate student, no matter how briefly, must apply for readmission, not admission, even if the new application is to a different program.</p>
<h4>Required Documents for Applications</h4>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Transcripts:  </strong>Applicants may upload <em>unofficial </em>transcripts with your application for the departmental initial review. <em>If the applicant is admitted,</em> then <em>official </em>transcripts of all college-level work will be required. Admitted applicants must request a current transcript from every post-secondary school attended, including community colleges, summer sessions, and extension programs. Official transcripts must be in sealed envelopes as issued by the school(s) attended. <span id="docs-internal-guid-8a340d6c-7fff-f0a1-0b77-26727fc0cfae">If the institution provides official electronic transcripts, they can be emailed directly from the institution</span>
	<div class="gmail_default">If you have attended Berkeley, upload your unofficial transcript with your application for the departmental initial review. </div>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Letters of recommendation:</strong> Applicants may request online letters of recommendation through the online application system. Hard copies of recommendation letters must be sent directly to the program, not the Graduate Division.</li>
	<li><strong>Evidence of English language proficiency:</strong> All applicants from countries or political entities in which the official language is not English are required to submit official evidence of English language proficiency. This applies to applicants from Bangladesh, Burma, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Latin America, the Middle East, the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, most European countries, and Quebec (Canada). However, applicants who, at the time of application, have already completed at least one year of full-time academic course work with grades of B or better at a US university may submit an official transcript from the US university to fulfill this requirement. The following courses will not fulfill this requirement: 1) courses in English as a Second Language, 2) courses conducted in a language other than English, 3) courses that will be completed after the application is submitted, and 4) courses of a non-academic nature. If applicants have previously been denied admission to Berkeley on the basis of their English language proficiency, they must submit new test scores that meet the current minimum from one of the standardized tests.</li>
</ol>

This course aims to improve the quality of decisions people make. Students learn to be aware of, and to avoid, common inferential errors and systematic biases in decision making. There are many decision traps that we tend to repeatedly fall into. These traps relate to how we think about risk and probability, how we learn from experience, and how we make choices. Upon completion, students will have internalized the basic principles of decision making and will be</span><span class="deschide"> able to avoid falling into these traps. The course additionally aims to create a deeper understanding of the psychology of decision making, which can create an advantage in negotiations and other interactions through gaining an awareness of the predictable mistakes of others.</span><br/>

This course intends to help students apply the skills of applied innovation in a loosely-structured, open-ended project. Students will learn advanced techniques in the innovation process and apply it to a project of their choice. The course is loosely structured and includes a lot of coaching time with faculty, as well as feedback and critique time with peers. The course largely follows the innovation cycle — observe and notice, frame and reframe, imagine and design</span><span class="deschide">, and make and test — but does so nonlinearly.</span><br/>

Students learn about the key strategic choices that shape whether companies deliver real value to stakeholders. They are taught to organize the strategic choices into four different strategy “playbooks” that they can use to systematically consider alternate strategies for a startup, and the core elements needed to make these strategies work: Intellectual Property Strategy, Disruptive Strategy, Value Chain Strategy, and Architectural Strategy. Students must (a) analyze</span><span class="deschide"> cases, thinking systematically through what they would do if they were a founder or early-employee in the protagonists’ shoes; (b) engage in class discussions, treating the classroom as a laboratory; and (c) formulate a real strategic plan for a final strategy assignment.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p class="Normal1">The Department of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning offers a professional graduate degree, the Master of Landscape Architecture (MLA), and a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning.</p>
<h3>Master of Landscape Architecture (MLA)</h3>
<p>The Master of Landscape Architecture degree is a professional degree accredited by the Landscape Architecture Accreditation Board, part of the American Society of Landscape Architects and qualifies graduates for licensure in California and elsewhere. The MLA program is certified as a STEM discipline. The program offers advanced education in landscape architecture and environmental planning from the scale of the site to the region to the ecosystem. The MLA requires a set of core courses for all students emphasizing cross-scaler analysis, representation, design, and planning. This core pedagogy forms the foundation for extended coursework in specialized aspects of landscape design and environmental planning.</p>
<h3>Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning</h3>
<p>The Doctor of Philosophy encompasses advanced research in the field of landscape architecture and environmental planning. It requires the development of original research that contributes to the theories, methods, and knowledge in the field. The program particularly emphasizes the development of research which applies social and ecological science methods to illuminate the complexities of decision-making regarding human alteration of the landscape and its outcomes for the local and global environment. The PhD degree in Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning is appropriate for those seeking careers in academia, research institutions, and leadership roles in non-profits, government, and professional consultation.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/landscape-architecture-environmental-planning/" target="_blank">See Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="admissionstext"></a><h2>Admissions</h2><h3>Admission to the University</h3>
 <h4>Minimum Requirements for Admission</h4> <p>The following minimum requirements apply to all graduate programs and will be verified by the Graduate Division:</p> <ol> 	<li>A bachelor’s degree or recognized equivalent from an accredited institution;</li> 	<li>A grade point average of B or better (3.0);</li> 	<li>If the applicant has completed a basic degree from a country or political entity (e.g., Quebec) where English is not the official language, adequate proficiency in English to do graduate work, as evidenced by a TOEFL score of at least 90 on the iBT test, 570 on the paper-and-pencil test, or an IELTS Band score of at least 7 on a 9-point scale (note that individual programs may set higher levels for any of these); and</li> 	<li>Sufficient undergraduate training to do graduate work in the given field.</li> </ol> <h4>Applicants Who Already Hold a Graduate Degree</h4> <p>The Graduate Council views academic degrees not as vocational training certificates, but as evidence of broad training in research methods, independent study, and articulation of learning. Therefore, applicants who already have academic graduate degrees should be able to pursue new subject matter at an advanced level without the need to enroll in a related or similar graduate program.</p> <p>Programs may consider students for an additional academic master’s or professional master’s degree only if the additional degree is in a distinctly different field.</p> <p>Applicants admitted to a doctoral program that requires a master’s degree to be earned at Berkeley as a prerequisite (even though the applicant already has a master’s degree from another institution in the same or a closely allied field of study) will be permitted to undertake the second master’s degree, despite the overlap in field.</p> <p>The Graduate Division will admit students for a second doctoral degree only if they meet the following guidelines:</p> <ol> 	<li>Applicants with doctoral degrees may be admitted for an additional doctoral degree only if that degree program is in a general area of knowledge distinctly different from the field in which they earned their original degree. For example, a physics PhD could be admitted to a doctoral degree program in music or history; however, a student with a doctoral degree in mathematics would not be permitted to add a PhD in statistics.</li> 	<li>Applicants who hold the PhD degree may be admitted to a professional doctorate or professional master’s degree program if there is no duplication of training involved.</li> </ol> <p>Applicants may apply only to one single degree program or one concurrent degree program per admission cycle.</p> <h4>Required Documents for Applications</h4> <ol> 	<li><strong>Transcripts: </strong>Applicants may upload <em>unofficial </em>transcripts with your application for the departmental initial review. Unofficial transcripts must contain specific information including the name of the applicant, name of the school, all courses, grades, units, &amp; degree conferral (if applicable). </li> 	<li><strong>Letters of recommendation:</strong> Applicants may request online letters of recommendation through the online application system. Hard copies of recommendation letters must be sent directly to the program, by the recommender, not the Graduate Admissions.</li> 	<li> 	<p><strong><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">Evidence of English language proficiency:</span> </strong>All applicants who have completed a basic degree from a country or political entity in which the official language is not English are required to submit official evidence of English language proficiency. This applies to institutions from Bangladesh, Burma, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Latin America, the Middle East, the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, most European countries, and Quebec (Canada). However, applicants who, at the time of application, have already completed at least one year of full-time academic course work with grades of B or better at a US university may submit an official transcript from the US university to fulfill this requirement. The following courses will not fulfill this requirement:</p> 	<ul> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses in English as a Second Language,</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses conducted in a language other than English,</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses that will be completed after the application is submitted, and</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses of a non-academic nature.</span></p> 		</li> 	</ul> 	</li> </ol> <p style="margin-left:30pt"><span><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">Applicants who have previously applied to Berkeley must also submit new test scores that meet the current minimum requirement from one of the standardized tests. Official TOEFL score reports must be sent directly from Educational Test Services (ETS). The institution code for Berkeley is 4833 for Graduate Organizations. Official IELTS score reports must be sent electronically from the testing center to University of California, Berkeley, Graduate Division, Sproul Hall, Rm 318 MC 5900, Berkeley, CA 94720. TOEFL and IELTS score reports are only valid for two years prior to beginning the graduate program at UC Berkeley. </span></span>Note: score reports can not expire before the month of June.</p> <div> </div> <h4>Where to Apply</h4> <p>Visit the Berkeley Graduate Division <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply/" target="_blank">application page</a>. </p>
<h3>Admission to the MLA Program</h3>
<p>A bachelor's degree is the minimum requirement for admission to the graduate program. It is recommended that applicants have completed a minimum of one basic course each in the life, earth and social sciences. In addition, graphics and freehand drawing are strongly recommended for applicants with non-design backgrounds. The MLA 3D is accredited by the Landscape Architecture Accreditation Board part of the American Society of Landscape Architects. The department also offers two specialized advanced standing options for the accredited degree based on previous degrees, the MLA 2D and the MLA EP.</p>

				<a name="mastersdegreerequirementstext"></a><h2>Master's Degree Requirements</h2><p>The Department of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning offers three Master of Landscape Architecture (MLA) degree options accredited by the Landscape Architecture Accreditation Board (LAAB) of American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA) structured to provide advanced professional learning in landscape design and planning:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The <a href="http://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/landscape-architecture-environmental-planning/programs/master-of-landscape-architecture/first-professional-degree" target="_blank">three-year MLA degree</a> is the first professional degree for students with non-design backgrounds.</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/landscape-architecture-environmental-planning/programs/master-of-landscape-architecture/second-professional-degree" target="_blank">two-year MLA degree</a> offers two advanced standing options for students with first degrees in landscape architecture, architecture, or environmental design.  There is a curriculum for students with an undergraduate degree in landscape architecture and a curriculum for students with an undergraduate degree in architecture or environmental design.</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/landscape-architecture-environmental-planning/programs/master-of-landscape-architecture/environmental-planning" target="_blank">two-year environmental planning </a>is an advanced standing option for students with first degrees in landscape architecture, architecture, the environmental sciences, city planning, or related degrees.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Degree Requirements</strong></h4>
<p>Students are required to select and complete one of two plans for the degree: Plan I—Thesis, or Plan II—Comprehensive Exam (professional project or designated studio.) The thesis is for students who wish to do original research on a problem in landscape architecture or environmental planning. The thesis committee is composed of two faculty members from the Department of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning and a third faculty member from another department at Berkeley. The comprehensive exam format can be either a professional project or a designated studio that demonstrates broad competence plus the concepts and skills necessary to the field of landscape architecture. The professional project comprises a real-world project. The professional project committee is comprised of two faculty members (the committee chair must be a faculty member from the Department of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning) and an optional third member from outside the University community affiliated with the project.</p>
<p>Students may elect to fulfill the final degree requirement through the successful completion of a comprehensive exam studio taken in their final semester. Students who are in the Environmental Planning track or in one of the concurrent degree programs are not eligible for the comprehensive exam studio option.  Students in the concurrent degree programs must see the Graduate Student Affairs Officer for details on degree completion procedures and requirements.</p>
<p>In addition, a summer internship (preferably taken the summer before the student's final year) is recommended. Previous professional experience may be substituted for this internship.</p>
<p>Normative time for the MLA degree is either two years (design background and environmental planning students) or three years (non-design background). A student's normative time is determined when the student enters the MLA program.</p>
<h4><strong>Public Information Policy</strong></h4>
<p>Public Information Policy Programs accredited by the Landscape Architectural Accreditation Board (LAAB) are required to provide reliable information to the public.

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p class="Normal1"><span>Geography is an inquiry into the patterns and processes that make up the surface of the Earth. It is a broad field of inquiry that, in our department, includes glaciers and climate change, the origins of agriculture and the evolution of plant life, the culture of cities and the dynamics of the global economy. </span></p>
<p class="Normal1"><span>Such a wide range of themes gives each student great freedom to choose a research topic, develop an intellectual style, and select approaches to gathering evidence and making persuasive arguments. That freedom also includes opportunities to go outside of the department and make use of the tremendous resources of the campus as a whole. Our goal is to help each student find his or her own combination of intellectual rigor, creativity, and independence.</span></p>
<p class="introtext"><strong>Ph.D. Program in Geography</strong></p>
<p class="Normal1">The program is divided into three major areas:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="Normal1">Global Development and Political Economy</li>
	<li class="Normal1">Earth System Science</li>
	<li class="Normal1">Geospatial Representation and Analysis</li>
</ul>
<p class="Normal1">Within these domains, a wide range of faculty interests are represented, such as political ecology, economic geography, cultural geography, post-colonial studies, urban studies, geography of race and gender, climatology, geomorphology, remote sensing, and geographic information systems (GIS). Faculty members come with a broad spectrum of regional specialties as well, including Africa, South and East Asia, the Arctic, the Everglades and Mississippi Delta, Brazil, the Caribbean, and Latin America.</p>
<p class="Normal1">The faculty has been expanded in recent years to include a number of affiliates in other departments with expertise in such fields as GIS, gender and social movements, natural resources, fluvial geomorphology, environmental engineering, landscape ecology, and urban planning.</p>
<p class="Normal1">Berkeley students are expected to be independent, and we welcome those who have had professional experience and wish to return to deepen their education. Students are encouraged to range freely through the curriculum and to follow their inspiration where it leads, working in tandem with faculty advisors. Students choose their own mentors, often utilizing two or three faculty in equal measure; these may include faculty affiliates and members from other departments.</p>
<p class="Normal1">While faculty have their own research agendas and teaching specialties, and often collaborate with students, we believe students should march to their own drummer. We expect students to read extensively, develop the necessary research skills, and produce well-crafted thesis and dissertation. Many students publish their findings along the way, as well. Berkeley Geography offers the highest quality graduate training for future scholars and teachers at the collegiate level, as well as for those going into professional careers in government, NGOs and consulting. </p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="https://geography.berkeley.edu/geography-studies/graduate-studies" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="admissionstext"></a><h2>Admissions</h2><h3 class="Normal1"><strong>General Admission Requirements for Graduate Study</strong></h3>
 <h4>Minimum Requirements for Admission</h4> <p>The following minimum requirements apply to all graduate programs and will be verified by the Graduate Division:</p> <ol> 	<li>A bachelor’s degree or recognized equivalent from an accredited institution;</li> 	<li>A grade point average of B or better (3.0);</li> 	<li>If the applicant has completed a basic degree from a country or political entity (e.g., Quebec) where English is not the official language, adequate proficiency in English to do graduate work, as evidenced by a TOEFL score of at least 90 on the iBT test, 570 on the paper-and-pencil test, or an IELTS Band score of at least 7 on a 9-point scale (note that individual programs may set higher levels for any of these); and</li> 	<li>Sufficient undergraduate training to do graduate work in the given field.</li> </ol> <h4>Applicants Who Already Hold a Graduate Degree</h4> <p>The Graduate Council views academic degrees not as vocational training certificates, but as evidence of broad training in research methods, independent study, and articulation of learning. Therefore, applicants who already have academic graduate degrees should be able to pursue new subject matter at an advanced level without the need to enroll in a related or similar graduate program.</p> <p>Programs may consider students for an additional academic master’s or professional master’s degree only if the additional degree is in a distinctly different field.</p> <p>Applicants admitted to a doctoral program that requires a master’s degree to be earned at Berkeley as a prerequisite (even though the applicant already has a master’s degree from another institution in the same or a closely allied field of study) will be permitted to undertake the second master’s degree, despite the overlap in field.</p> <p>The Graduate Division will admit students for a second doctoral degree only if they meet the following guidelines:</p> <ol> 	<li>Applicants with doctoral degrees may be admitted for an additional doctoral degree only if that degree program is in a general area of knowledge distinctly different from the field in which they earned their original degree. For example, a physics PhD could be admitted to a doctoral degree program in music or history; however, a student with a doctoral degree in mathematics would not be permitted to add a PhD in statistics.</li> 	<li>Applicants who hold the PhD degree may be admitted to a professional doctorate or professional master’s degree program if there is no duplication of training involved.</li> </ol> <p>Applicants may apply only to one single degree program or one concurrent degree program per admission cycle.</p> <h4>Required Documents for Applications</h4> <ol> 	<li><strong>Transcripts: </strong>Applicants may upload <em>unofficial </em>transcripts with your application for the departmental initial review. Unofficial transcripts must contain specific information including the name of the applicant, name of the school, all courses, grades, units, &amp; degree conferral (if applicable). </li> 	<li><strong>Letters of recommendation:</strong> Applicants may request online letters of recommendation through the online application system. Hard copies of recommendation letters must be sent directly to the program, by the recommender, not the Graduate Admissions.</li> 	<li> 	<p><strong><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">Evidence of English language proficiency:</span> </strong>All applicants who have completed a basic degree from a country or political entity in which the official language is not English are required to submit official evidence of English language proficiency. This applies to institutions from Bangladesh, Burma, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Latin America, the Middle East, the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, most European countries, and Quebec (Canada). However, applicants who, at the time of application, have already completed at least one year of full-time academic course work with grades of B or better at a US university may submit an official transcript from the US university to fulfill this requirement. The following courses will not fulfill this requirement:</p> 	<ul> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses in English as a Second Language,</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses conducted in a language other than English,</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses that will be completed after the application is submitted, and</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses of a non-academic nature.</span></p> 		</li> 	</ul> 	</li> </ol> <p style="margin-left:30pt"><span><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">Applicants who have previously applied to Berkeley must also submit new test scores that meet the current minimum requirement from one of the standardized tests. Official TOEFL score reports must be sent directly from Educational Test Services (ETS). The institution code for Berkeley is 4833 for Graduate Organizations. Official IELTS score reports must be sent electronically from the testing center to University of California, Berkeley, Graduate Division, Sproul Hall, Rm 318 MC 5900, Berkeley, CA 94720. TOEFL and IELTS score reports are only valid for two years prior to beginning the graduate program at UC Berkeley. </span></span>Note: score reports can not expire before the month of June.</p> <div> </div> <h4>Where to Apply</h4> <p>Visit the Berkeley Graduate Division <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply/" target="_blank">application page</a>. </p>
<h3 class="Normal1"><strong>Additional Departmental Application Requirements </strong></h3>
<p>In addition to the information and documents required by the Graduate Division, the Geography Department asks all prospective applicants to include the following materials in their application:</p>

	<li>Applicants are asked to list the faculty they have contacted or expect to contact concerning their application, as well as the faculty in the department whose research is of particular interest to them and who they can foresee as a potential advisor. </li>
	<li>Resumes or CVs are optional, but highly recommended.</li>
	<li>Writing samples are optional.<br/>
	 </li>
</ul>
<p class="introtext"><strong><span>Important Notes:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><span>The geography department does NOT admit students for a Master’s degree. Students may only apply for the Ph.D. program in geography.</span></li>
	<li>The department does NOT offer admission for spring terms; students may only apply for programs that begin with the fall term.<br/>
	 </li>

				<a name="doctoraldegreerequirementstext"></a><h2>Doctoral Degree Requirements</h2><h3 class="Normal1CxSpFirst"><strong>General Program Outline</strong></h3>
<p class="introtext"><strong>First Year Curriculum and Course Enrollment</strong></p>
<p>All students take <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GEOG%20200A" title="GEOG 200A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GEOG 200A');">GEOG 200A</a></span> in their first year. This course is designed to help each student to see, think, and write geographically; to learn how to make and to judge arguments; and to prepare a thesis proposal. Students with a Human Geography focus will also take <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GEOG%20200B" title="GEOG 200B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GEOG 200B');">GEOG 200B</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GEOG%20200C" title="GEOG 200C" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GEOG 200C');">GEOG 200C</a></span> following <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GEOG%20200A" title="GEOG 200A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GEOG 200A');">GEOG 200A</a></span>.</p>
<p>Those with an Earth Systems Science focus are exempt from <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GEOG%20200B" title="GEOG 200B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GEOG 200B');">GEOG 200B</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GEOG%20200C" title="GEOG 200C" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GEOG 200C');">GEOG 200C</a></span> (these students will take a course identified by their faculty adviser). All students in the doctoral program must take at least 12 units every semester (primarily in the form of appropriate graduate seminars) before taking the qualifying exam and advancing to candidacy. In addition, students must enroll in the Geography Colloquium (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GEOG%20295" title="GEOG 295" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GEOG 295');">GEOG 295</a></span>). This is a weekly colloquium which features invited speakers.</p>
<p class="introtext"><strong>Analytic Paper </strong></p>
<p>By the end of the third year, students entering with only a bachelor's degree must hand in a paper that would be suitable—in length and in quality—for submission to an academic or scientific journal. Students entering with a master's degree are exempt from this requirement.</p>
<p>The analytic paper may be an investigation of an intellectual problem in the form of an original synthesis of secondary literature; it may advance a new idea, or question an existing theory or notion, by assembling information that already exists in the literature; or it may use original information gathered from archives or in the field.</p>
<p>The student should have a proposal for the paper by the end of the first year, and must be in constant and close consultation with their main adviser. The adviser will determine the appropriate format and length of the paper. The paper must be handed in, and approved by the main adviser, no less than a month before the qualifying exam. A copy of the paper with the adviser's approval should be turned in to the Graduate Student Affairs Officer.</p>
<p class="introtext"><strong>Dissertation Prospectus</strong></p>
<p>Prior to taking the qualifying exam, all students must prepare a preliminary dissertation prospectus of between five and ten pages for their exam committee. A prospectus is a valuable first step in writing a dissertation, as it requires students to clarify their project and create a plan for carrying out their research. Before students begin their dissertation research, they must have a dissertation prospectus meeting—during which the student discusses their proposal—with at least two members of their QE committee. </p>
<p class="introtext"><strong>Qualifying Exam</strong></p>
<p>The qualifying exam must be taken by the end of the third year, although it is recommended that students entering with a master's degree take it by the end of their second year. The exam is based on a discussion of three broad geographic fields built around bibliographies produced in consultation with the examining committee.</p>
<p>Immediately after passing the QE, students will apply to the Graduate Division for advancement to candidacy. Advancing to candidacy by the end of the third year qualifies a student for the <a href="https://grad.berkeley.edu/policy/degrees-policy/#f31-doctoral-completion-fellowship-dcf" target="_blank">Dissertation Completion Fellowship</a>. </p>
<p class="introtext"><strong>Additional Departmental Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li class="introtext">As part of their training, all students will be expected to serve as graduate student instructors (GSIs) for at least one semester.</li>
	<li class="introtext">Students will be expected to complete an annual review with their first-year mentor or their faculty advisor each year to ensure timely completion of degree requirements. </li>
	<li class="introtext">All students are expected to give an exit talk during the semester in which they file their dissertation.</li>
</ul>
<p class="introtext"><strong>Timeline of Degree Conferral</strong></p>
<p><span>The dissertation is written under the supervision of a committee of three university faculty members, one of whom must be from outside the geography department and a member of the Berkeley Academic Senate. All students must give the department a copy of their thesis before their final report to the Graduate Division will be signed. </span>Upon final acceptance of the dissertation, the degree of Ph.D. is awarded. It is expected that the student will complete the Ph.D. by the end of the sixth year in the program.</p>

The class has several goals. One is to give students a sound basis upon which to judge arguments. A second is to help students see, think, and write geographically--that is, to interpret the making and meaning of our physical and human landscapes. A third goal is to introduce students to the tremendous range of geographical inquiry and what is probably the major strength of geography as a form of thought: to wit, making links across space, among</span><span class="deschide"> peoples, and between humans and the earth. The fall semester class also serves to introduce students to the practices and expectations of scholarly work more generally, including professionalization, publishing, and public speaking.</span><br/>

The relationship between societies and natural environments lies at the heart of geographical inquiry and has gained urgency as the rate and scale of human transformation of nature have grown, often outstripping our understanding of causes and effects. The physical side of environmental science has received most of the emphasis in university research, but the social basis of environmental change must be studied as well. Recent developments in social</span><span class="deschide"> theory have much to offer environmental studies, while the latter has, in turn, exploded many formerly safe assumptions about how and what the social sciences and humanities ought to be preoccupied with. This seminar allows students to explore some classics in environmental thought as well as recent contributions that put the field on the forefront of social knowledge today.</span><br/>

This graduate seminar explores the inextricable connection between blackness and geography.<br/>
Considering Katherine McKittrick’s claim that Black geographies are “‘the terrain of political<br/>
struggle itself’ or where the imperative of a perspective of struggle takes place,” we will situate<br/>
the spatial relations of blackness by placing Black people at the core of spatial production and<br/>
examine the mechanisms by which this takes</span><span class="deschide"> place. In this course we ask: what are the<br/>
limitations and possibilities of traditional geographies? How does Black geographic thought<br/>
produce wider material and conceptual space for geographic knowledge? How does Geography<br/>
account for and understand blackness as condition, experience, and imaginary?</span><br/>

Each text that falls under the “Black Spatial Matters” category will be followed by a corresponding “Black Space Matters” text. The two texts should be thought directly in relation to one another. Throughout the course we will engage such themes as Black cities, Black economies, Black poetics, and Black value by drawing on intellectual histories and politics of Black feminist, queer, indigenous, post-colonial, and critical race studies.<br/></p></div>

We grapple with what &quot;value&quot; means in &quot;Capital&quot;, paying particular attention to issues of historical specificity, abstract labor time, and the &quot;value theory of labor.&quot; We spatialize the argument by a close reading of David Harvey, and we look at attempts to understand capital's relation</span><span class="deschide"> to human action and other forms of value, in anthropology and the work of Pierre Bourdieu.

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> This class is a revised version of a class called ‘Spatial simulation modeling’ (Geography 228), but replaces computer simulation with board games as a vehicle for exploring how to abstractly represent processes and relations in the world. The aim is to develop an understanding of practices of ‘world-building’, using board games as an accessible point of entry to these practices. To do computer simulation requires learning how to program (‘to code’ as people insist of calling it today), which is a fine ambition but is distinct from the much more fundamental practices of abstraction, quantification, systems analysis, and so forth that underpin building simulation models. Working with board games instead of computational models will helps us get to the heart of those practices a lot more easily without the distraction of learning to program.<br/></p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> It is important to note that this is not a game design class; it is not a game theory class; and it is not a cultural studies of games class, although students may learn a little (or even a lot) about all these things, particularly the first. We will look at a lot of games during the semester, as a way to understand games as systems of interacting mechanics, preparatory to student projects which will develop either entirely new games or (probably more likely) develop variants of existing games to align the game’s model of the world more closely with aspects they wish to explore.</p></div>

Applying a complex-systems approach to environmental problems can yield valuable insight into risk, potential drivers of change, likely outcomes of perturbation, and whether it is even possible to forecast or manage system behavior. This course explores complex-systems theory and applications in geography, ecology, and earth science. Case studies include climate change, coupled human-environmental systems, vegetation community change, river</span><span class="deschide"> networks, forest fires, earthquakes, and peatlands.</span><br/>

This course introduces graduate students to a range of applications of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in geographical research, and theoretical considerations of the meaning, strengths, and limitations of the methods. We first review, in general, how geographic variables can be represented in a database. This leads to an extended discussion of the application of GIS methods to a variety of problems in physical and human geography, using topographic data, census</span><span class="deschide"> data, and other sources, manipulated by widely used GIS software. Students build skills and understanding through work on example problems. Finally, the broad question of how GIS represents geographic variables, and the strengths and limitations of the technique, are re-visited using perspective gained from examples. Students will be expected to elaborate these issues in the context of their own research programs.</span><br/>

This course centers the work of teaching as a foundational aspect of our practice as geographers. Undoubtedly, the interdisciplinary nature of geography provides multiple avenues from where we can address some of our most pressing social, environmental, economic and political dilemmas. But how do we bring theory to practice? And how do we do this in a classroom setting? To answer these questions, this course offers pedagogical frameworks and practical skills</span><span class="deschide"> for how theory and practice connect for both instructors and students. We will begin with a review of pedagogical literature and an analysis of how foundational scholars like Paulo Freire and bell hooks approach teaching as an act of community-making and empowerment.</span><br/>

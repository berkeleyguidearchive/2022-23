				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p class="Normal1">The Goldman School of Public Policy (GSPP) offers three graduate degrees in public policy, the Master of Public Policy (MPP), the Master of Public Affairs (MPA), and the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD).</p>
<h3 class="Normal1">Master in Public Policy (MPP)</h3>
<p class="Normal1">The MPP degree is earned in a two year, full-time program consisting of a core curriculum, a policy internship in the summer after completion of the first year, a second-year policy analysis project, and elective courses chosen from those available on the campus and at GSPP. The program emphasizes practical and applied dimensions of policy-making and implementation, encouraging students to develop skills in:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="Normal1">Defining policy issues to make them more intelligible to officials in the public, private or non-profit sector</li>
	<li class="Normal1">Providing a broader perspective for assessing policy alternatives</li>
	<li class="Normal1">Examining techniques for developing policy options and evaluating their social consequences</li>
	<li class="Normal1">Developing strategies for the successful implementation of public policies once they have been adopted</li>
</ul>
<p class="Normal1">Given the relatively small class size, the school's approach to teaching emphasizes teamwork, cooperation, and interaction among students and with the faculty. Students work, either as individuals or in small groups, on real policy problems for real clients under close faculty supervision.</p>
<h3 class="Normal1">Concurrent Degrees</h3>
<p class="Normal1">The Master in Public Policy may be earned in combination with an advanced degree from a number of Berkeley schools under a coordinated program. Applicants must be accepted to both programs to pursue a concurrent degree.</p>

</ul>
<h3 class="Normal1">Master of Public Affairs (MPA)</h3>
<p class="Normal1">The Berkeley Master of Public Affairs (MPA) is a flexible one-year degree program for domestic and international mid-career professionals with an average of seven years or more work experience and who have led or managed teams. Emphasizing innovation and leadership skills, the MPA curriculum prepares mid-career executives and professionals to act as strategic and visionary leaders and advance their careers.</p>
<p class="Normal1">Please visit the <a href="https://gspp.berkeley.edu/programs/masters-of-public-affairs-mpa" target="_blank">school website</a> for more information about the MPA.</p>
<h3 class="Normal1">PhD in Public Policy</h3>
<p>GSPP offers a doctoral degree program for students who seek careers in academia and/or with governments, non-profits, or research institutes. Usually, only two or three PhD applicants are admitted each year. The program emphasizes the generation of knowledge, theories, methodologies, and applications appropriate to the advancement of public policy analysis and management. Doctoral students pursue highly individualized programs of study and typically work closely with Goldman faculty members who share the student’s subject matter of interest. The doctoral program provides enormous flexibility in the topics addressed and the program of study but is directed mainly at training academic social science researchers with an interest in policy issues.</p>
<p>A thorough preparation in or aptitude for rigorous policy analysis skills is a prerequisite for the doctorate. Because there is no core program of study, the PhD committee prefers applicants to have completed an MPP or equivalent, or some other indication of sustained interest in (and aptitude for) public policy.  Visit the <a href="https://gspp.berkeley.edu/programs/doctoral-program-phd/applying-for-the-phd" target="_blank">&quot;Applying for the PhD&quot;</a> page for more information and specific application procedures.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://gspp.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit School Website</a></p>

				<a name="admissionstext"></a><h2>Admissions</h2><h3>Admission to the University</h3>
 <h4>Minimum Requirements for Admission</h4> <p>The following minimum requirements apply to all graduate programs and will be verified by the Graduate Division:</p> <ol> 	<li>A bachelor’s degree or recognized equivalent from an accredited institution;</li> 	<li>A grade point average of B or better (3.0);</li> 	<li>If the applicant has completed a basic degree from a country or political entity (e.g., Quebec) where English is not the official language, adequate proficiency in English to do graduate work, as evidenced by a TOEFL score of at least 90 on the iBT test, 570 on the paper-and-pencil test, or an IELTS Band score of at least 7 on a 9-point scale (note that individual programs may set higher levels for any of these); and</li> 	<li>Sufficient undergraduate training to do graduate work in the given field.</li> </ol> <h4>Applicants Who Already Hold a Graduate Degree</h4> <p>The Graduate Council views academic degrees not as vocational training certificates, but as evidence of broad training in research methods, independent study, and articulation of learning. Therefore, applicants who already have academic graduate degrees should be able to pursue new subject matter at an advanced level without the need to enroll in a related or similar graduate program.</p> <p>Programs may consider students for an additional academic master’s or professional master’s degree only if the additional degree is in a distinctly different field.</p> <p>Applicants admitted to a doctoral program that requires a master’s degree to be earned at Berkeley as a prerequisite (even though the applicant already has a master’s degree from another institution in the same or a closely allied field of study) will be permitted to undertake the second master’s degree, despite the overlap in field.</p> <p>The Graduate Division will admit students for a second doctoral degree only if they meet the following guidelines:</p> <ol> 	<li>Applicants with doctoral degrees may be admitted for an additional doctoral degree only if that degree program is in a general area of knowledge distinctly different from the field in which they earned their original degree. For example, a physics PhD could be admitted to a doctoral degree program in music or history; however, a student with a doctoral degree in mathematics would not be permitted to add a PhD in statistics.</li> 	<li>Applicants who hold the PhD degree may be admitted to a professional doctorate or professional master’s degree program if there is no duplication of training involved.</li> </ol> <p>Applicants may apply only to one single degree program or one concurrent degree program per admission cycle.</p> <h4>Required Documents for Applications</h4> <ol> 	<li><strong>Transcripts: </strong>Applicants may upload <em>unofficial </em>transcripts with your application for the departmental initial review. Unofficial transcripts must contain specific information including the name of the applicant, name of the school, all courses, grades, units, &amp; degree conferral (if applicable). </li> 	<li><strong>Letters of recommendation:</strong> Applicants may request online letters of recommendation through the online application system. Hard copies of recommendation letters must be sent directly to the program, by the recommender, not the Graduate Admissions.</li> 	<li> 	<p><strong><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">Evidence of English language proficiency:</span> </strong>All applicants who have completed a basic degree from a country or political entity in which the official language is not English are required to submit official evidence of English language proficiency. This applies to institutions from Bangladesh, Burma, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Latin America, the Middle East, the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, most European countries, and Quebec (Canada). However, applicants who, at the time of application, have already completed at least one year of full-time academic course work with grades of B or better at a US university may submit an official transcript from the US university to fulfill this requirement. The following courses will not fulfill this requirement:</p> 	<ul> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses in English as a Second Language,</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses conducted in a language other than English,</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses that will be completed after the application is submitted, and</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses of a non-academic nature.</span></p> 		</li> 	</ul> 	</li> </ol> <p style="margin-left:30pt"><span><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">Applicants who have previously applied to Berkeley must also submit new test scores that meet the current minimum requirement from one of the standardized tests. Official TOEFL score reports must be sent directly from Educational Test Services (ETS). The institution code for Berkeley is 4833 for Graduate Organizations. Official IELTS score reports must be sent electronically from the testing center to University of California, Berkeley, Graduate Division, Sproul Hall, Rm 318 MC 5900, Berkeley, CA 94720. TOEFL and IELTS score reports are only valid for two years prior to beginning the graduate program at UC Berkeley. </span></span>Note: score reports can not expire before the month of June.</p> <div> </div> <h4>Where to Apply</h4> <p>Visit the Berkeley Graduate Division <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply/" target="_blank">application page</a>. </p>
<h3>Admission to the Program</h3>
<h4>Key Elements for MPP Admission</h4>
<p><em>Note:</em> For some admissions requirements, GSPP maintains more stringent requirements than the Graduate Division. Please see <a href="http://gspp.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">gspp.berkeley.edu</a> for more information or email your general questions to <a href="mailto:mppadm@berkeley.edu">mppadm@berkeley.edu</a>.</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>A Commitment to Public Policy:</strong> GSPP’s goal is to admit those applicants who can get the most from the GSPP master’s program and who will use what they learn to be active participants in the formulation, adoption, and implementation of better public policy. One of the applicant’s goals should be to convince the admissions committee of this commitment. This can be reflected in the quality of work experience, the statement of purpose or personal history statement.</li>
	<li><strong>Education: </strong>Students at GSPP represent a wide range of academic backgrounds. Most students have degrees in social sciences, with a smaller number having undergraduate majors in humanities, biological or physical sciences, mathematics or engineering. Some students already have advanced degrees. GSPP does not require prior quantitative training; however prior course work in introductory statistics or first-year calculus, and introductory microeconomics, is strongly recommended.</li>
	<li><strong>Writing and Analytical Skills:</strong> How students approach problems and the ability to write clearly and coherently is instrumental in public policy analysis. The committee will pay close attention to the applicant’s statement of purpose and GRE analytical writing score.</li>
	<li><strong>Standardized Tests:</strong> For the Fall 2022 application cycle, applicants were required to submit official GRE scores OR a quantitative resume, however the GRE requirement for the Fall 2023 application has not yet been determined. Please visit <a href="https://gspp.berkeley.edu/programs/masters-of-public-policy-mpp/applying-for-the-mpp" target="_blank">Applying for the MPP</a> for the most up to date information regarding the GRE after July 1st. The LSAT and GMAT cannot be substituted for the GRE. Test scores must be less than five years old. ETS will not report scores older than five years. To assist you in preparing to take the GRE, free GRE Preparation Tests are now available <a href="http://www.ets.org/gre" target="_blank">online</a>. <br/>
	All applicants from countries in which the official language is not English are required to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (<a href="http://www.ets.org/toefl" target="_blank">TOEFL</a>) or the International English Language Testing System (<a href="http://www.ielts.org/" target="_blank">IELTS</a>). For Fall 2023, <span class="s1">TOEFL and IELTS tests taken before June 1, 2021  will not be accepted even if your score was reported to Berkeley previously. To send an official score report, the institution code for Berkeley is 4833 (Graduate Programs). </span><strong>NOTE: The <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/requirements/#evidence-of-english-language-proficiency" target="_blank">Graduate Division</a> includes a third exemption for those who have completed at least one year of full-time academic course work with a grade B or better at a regionally accredited institution within the United States. </strong></li>
	<li><strong>Three Letters of Recommendation:</strong> The most helpful letters or recommendation are from persons who have supervised the applicant’s work in either an academic, employment or community service capacity, and who can evaluate the applicant’s intellectual ability, creativity, initiative, leadership potential, and promise in the field of public policy analysis and management. </li>
	<li><strong>Background and Life Experiences: </strong>GSPP recognizes that a student population that reflects the most diverse state in the country is key to the continued study of current, relevant social issues and policy problems. We are looking for people who are dynamic and driven, representing diverse perspectives, backgrounds, and life experiences, particularly those who wish to develop the tools and skills necessary to change our world for the better. </li>
	<li><strong>The Value of Work Experience:</strong> Although GSPP does not require work experience for admission, typically each entering student has had at least three to four years of relevant work experience. GSPP believes work experience adds tremendous value to class discussions and helps students to develop a context for problem solving and policy analysis.</li>

<h4 class="Normal1">Key Elements for PhD Admission</h4>
<p>The PhD Program at the Goldman School is a small and individualized program in which we do our best to match the interests of prospective students with our faculty. A thorough preparation in policy analysis skills is a prerequisite for the doctorate. Because there is no core program of study, the PhD committee prefers applicants to have completed an MPP degree or equivalent, either from the Goldman School or a similar institution. Applicants with a master's degree in some other field usually must complete the MPP program at GSPP before applying for admission to the doctoral program. Applicants may be partially exempt from this requirement, but may be asked to take certain first-year level master's courses at the Goldman School not offered in such programs.</p>

				<a name="doctoraldegreerequirementstext"></a><h2>Doctoral Degree Requirements</h2><h4>Curriculum</h4>
<p>The PhD program emphasizes the generation of knowledge, theories, methodologies, and applications appropriate to the advancement of public policy analysis and management. Doctoral students pursue highly individualized programs of study, working closely with school faculty members to determine coursework to be taken in preparation for the dissertation. Students who have a master’s degree in public policy from another University may be may be asked to take certain first-year master’s level courses at GSPP not offered in other such programs.</p>
<p>Students must be enrolled in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PUB%20POL%20296" title="PUB POL 296" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PUB POL 296');">PUB POL 296</a> Ph.D. Seminar</span> each semester. Students may take any of the Goldman School graduate-level courses as electives (PUB POL or PUB AFF), or graduate-level courses in other campus departments, in consultation with their assigned PhD faculty advisor. </p>

<h4>Core Curriculum—First Year</h4>
<p>The core courses emphasize practical applications of analytical skills and encourage students to learn by doing through numerous exercises and projects conducted in teams and individually. Fieldwork activities are also a part of the core curriculum, involving real clients, a written report, and oral briefings on the report. In addition, colloquia with outside speakers are frequently held that further examine some of the policy issues treated in the core courses.</p>

<h4>Summer Policy Internship</h4>
<p>Students are required to complete a policy internship during the summer between the first and second year of study. Students choose positions as apprentices to policy practitioners in international, federal, state, or local government agencies; nonprofit organizations; or private sector corporations and consulting firms; in the United States and abroad. Students enrolled in concurrent degrees with Public Health, Law, Energy &amp; Resources Group, and Social Welfare can satisfy the Goldman School internship requirement with an internship that also meets the internship or summer field-placement requirements prescribed by the relevant concurrent degree requirement, as long as the internship also meets the Goldman School internship requirement.  For prior year summer internship statistics and information, go the <a href="http://gspp.berkeley.edu/career-services/alumni-graduation-facts/gspp-employment-statistics" target="_blank">Employment Statistics</a> page.</p>
<h4>Core Curriculum—Second Year</h4>
<p class="Normal1">The second year comprises two required courses, Advanced Policy Analysis (APA) and Political and Organizational Aspects of Public Policy Analysis, plus a number of electives.</p>
<p class="Normal1">The APA project is an intensive study of a significant policy issue of the student’s choice. The project is often done for a specific client in a public or private policy organization, and sometimes the student is paid for the work. For some students, the project is an outgrowth of the summer internship or may lead to a post-graduation position with the client organization.</p>
<p class="Normal1">Students conduct their projects as members of an APA seminar, which provides them with a faculty supervisor and a peer group able to supply constructive suggestions. When the completed analysis is found satisfactory by the faculty, it then serves as the student’s required thesis. Frequently, the specific policy recommendations made in these analyses have been adopted by the student’s client.</p>

This course focuses on the art and science of public</span><span class="deschide"> policy analysis. We address the following fundamental questions: What kinds of problems are public problems?

The course provides students an in-depth understanding of key issues and constraints facing top officials in running a city. The course examines the extent cities are viable: can they provide services residents demand and deserve; can they provide for public safety, jobs, housing, schools, basic services, and fill potholes? And there is the public interest question: viable for whom and in benefit of whom? Using Oakland and Bay Area cities as case studies</span><span class="deschide">, the course integrates direct front-line experience with broader conceptual analyses.

This class examines the racist history of public policy in the U.S. and teaches students to use radical imagination to inspire new policy ideas for a transformative social change. We will explore how the legacy of stolen land and human bondage persist in exclusionary government policies that generate, maintain, and enforce inequitable systems. We will learn from advocates, researchers, and practitioners engaged in the collective process of radical</span><span class="deschide"> imagination across a wide range of social spheres. Students will come to understand how policies can contribute to or mitigate the interlocking and mutually reinforcing nature of racism and anti-Blackness and will begin to envision policies towards building a thriving multiracial democracy.</span><br/>

This seminar appraises the critical policy choices that shape the lives of children and adolescents from birth through high school and beyond. The issues are as varied-and hotly debated by politicians and policy-makers-as banning Coke machines in schools to reduce obesity, regulating teenage abortion, providing universal preschool and helping abused children. Students from across the campus-public policy, education, social welfare, business</span><span class="deschide">, sociology, political science, economics-bring different perspectives. Discussions and readings draw on insights from across the policy sciences. Problem-solving is the focus in seminar meetings and research projects.</span><br/>

This seminar brings together two related frames for policy thinking: the ethics of policy, that is, what does it mean to do the right thing? and the intervention of policy, that is, how do new policy paradigms emerge? Those who seek to govern well inescapably confront questions of value in their political, professional, and personal choices. the discussion of ethical dilemmas, which will take up the first half of the semester, is designed to</span><span class="deschide"> provoke analytic reflection on the moral challenges and responsibilities of public policymaking in a democracy. The focus is on the many and often competing obligations, commitments and values that should guide public actors, as well as on the public principles that guide the design of good public policy. <big ideas:=""> Politics and conventional analytics dominate policy in the short run. But over the longer term, conceptualizations as varied as exit/voice/loyalty, satisficing, the tipping point, memes, winner-take-all, strong democracy, broken windows, and the prisoners dilemma profoundly influence the policy conservation.</big></span><br/>

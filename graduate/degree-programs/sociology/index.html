				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p>The Berkeley Sociology Graduate Program is the heart of our collective enterprise as a department. We have been able to recruit superlative students year after year thanks to the efforts of the University, the faculty, and our current graduate students. Students who come here find a graduate program that has been carefully designed to offer them a rich and complete sociological education, while simultaneously allowing space and incentives to explore and develop their original ideas.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://sociology.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

<h3 class="Normal1"><a id="AdmitBerkeley" name="AdmitBerkeley"></a>Admission to the University</h3>
 <h4>Minimum Requirements for Admission</h4> <p>The following minimum requirements apply to all graduate programs and will be verified by the Graduate Division:</p> <ol> 	<li>A bachelor’s degree or recognized equivalent from an accredited institution;</li> 	<li>A grade point average of B or better (3.0);</li> 	<li>If the applicant has completed a basic degree from a country or political entity (e.g., Quebec) where English is not the official language, adequate proficiency in English to do graduate work, as evidenced by a TOEFL score of at least 90 on the iBT test, 570 on the paper-and-pencil test, or an IELTS Band score of at least 7 on a 9-point scale (note that individual programs may set higher levels for any of these); and</li> 	<li>Sufficient undergraduate training to do graduate work in the given field.</li> </ol> <h4>Applicants Who Already Hold a Graduate Degree</h4> <p>The Graduate Council views academic degrees not as vocational training certificates, but as evidence of broad training in research methods, independent study, and articulation of learning. Therefore, applicants who already have academic graduate degrees should be able to pursue new subject matter at an advanced level without the need to enroll in a related or similar graduate program.</p> <p>Programs may consider students for an additional academic master’s or professional master’s degree only if the additional degree is in a distinctly different field.</p> <p>Applicants admitted to a doctoral program that requires a master’s degree to be earned at Berkeley as a prerequisite (even though the applicant already has a master’s degree from another institution in the same or a closely allied field of study) will be permitted to undertake the second master’s degree, despite the overlap in field.</p> <p>The Graduate Division will admit students for a second doctoral degree only if they meet the following guidelines:</p> <ol> 	<li>Applicants with doctoral degrees may be admitted for an additional doctoral degree only if that degree program is in a general area of knowledge distinctly different from the field in which they earned their original degree. For example, a physics PhD could be admitted to a doctoral degree program in music or history; however, a student with a doctoral degree in mathematics would not be permitted to add a PhD in statistics.</li> 	<li>Applicants who hold the PhD degree may be admitted to a professional doctorate or professional master’s degree program if there is no duplication of training involved.</li> </ol> <p>Applicants may apply only to one single degree program or one concurrent degree program per admission cycle.</p> <h4>Required Documents for Applications</h4> <ol> 	<li><strong>Transcripts: </strong>Applicants may upload <em>unofficial </em>transcripts with your application for the departmental initial review. Unofficial transcripts must contain specific information including the name of the applicant, name of the school, all courses, grades, units, &amp; degree conferral (if applicable). </li> 	<li><strong>Letters of recommendation:</strong> Applicants may request online letters of recommendation through the online application system. Hard copies of recommendation letters must be sent directly to the program, by the recommender, not the Graduate Admissions.</li> 	<li> 	<p><strong><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">Evidence of English language proficiency:</span> </strong>All applicants who have completed a basic degree from a country or political entity in which the official language is not English are required to submit official evidence of English language proficiency. This applies to institutions from Bangladesh, Burma, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Latin America, the Middle East, the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, most European countries, and Quebec (Canada). However, applicants who, at the time of application, have already completed at least one year of full-time academic course work with grades of B or better at a US university may submit an official transcript from the US university to fulfill this requirement. The following courses will not fulfill this requirement:</p> 	<ul> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses in English as a Second Language,</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses conducted in a language other than English,</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses that will be completed after the application is submitted, and</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses of a non-academic nature.</span></p> 		</li> 	</ul> 	</li> </ol> <p style="margin-left:30pt"><span><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">Applicants who have previously applied to Berkeley must also submit new test scores that meet the current minimum requirement from one of the standardized tests. Official TOEFL score reports must be sent directly from Educational Test Services (ETS). The institution code for Berkeley is 4833 for Graduate Organizations. Official IELTS score reports must be sent electronically from the testing center to University of California, Berkeley, Graduate Division, Sproul Hall, Rm 318 MC 5900, Berkeley, CA 94720. TOEFL and IELTS score reports are only valid for two years prior to beginning the graduate program at UC Berkeley. </span></span>Note: score reports can not expire before the month of June.</p> <div> </div> <h4>Where to Apply</h4> <p>Visit the Berkeley Graduate Division <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply/" target="_blank">application page</a>. </p>
<h3 class="Normal1"><a id="AdmitProgram" name="AdmitProgram"></a>Admission to the Program</h3>
<p>Applicants must hold a bachelor of arts degree or its equivalent from an institution of acceptable standing and may hold a master of arts in Sociology or another field. Previous concentration in Sociology is not required.</p>
<p>The department does not accept applicants interested in a terminal Master of Arts in Sociology; this graduate program leads to the PhD.</p>
<p>Official TOEFL score reports must be sent directly from Educational Test Services (ETS).  The institution code for Berkeley is 4833. Official IELTS score reports must be mailed directly to our office from British Council. TOEFL and IELTS score reports are only valid for two years. </p>
<h3>Additional Required Documents for Applications (continued from above)</h3>
<p><strong>4: Graduate Record Examinations (GRE):</strong> A GRE is required for our Ph.D program. GRE scores are only valid for 5 years.  There are no minimum required scores. </p>
<p><strong>5. Statement of Purpose: </strong>Please describe your aptitude and motivation for graduate study in your area of specialization, including your preparation for this field of study, your academic plans or research interests in your chosen area of study, and your future career goals. Please be specific about why UC Berkeley would be a good intellectual fit for you.</p>
<p><strong>6. Personal History Statement:</strong> In an essay, discuss how your personal background informs your decision to pursue a graduate degree. Please include any educational, familial, cultural, economic, or social experiences, challenges, or opportunities relevant to your academic journey; how you might contribute to social or cultural diversity within your chosen field; and/or how you might serve educationally underrepresented segments of society with your degree.</p>
<p><strong>7. Writing Sample:</strong> One Writing Sample of your work in English (e.g. term paper, thesis, publication). Written work should be non-fiction and conducive to evaluation on its own merit. Admission committee members are especially impressed with writing samples that attempt to link theoretically informed arguments with empirical evidence. The average length is 15-20 pages. </p>

				<a name="doctoraldegreerequirementstext"></a><h2>Doctoral Degree Requirements</h2><h3>Required Courses</h3>
<p>Students are required to take a minimum of eight courses for the MA. An additional three courses for a total of eleven courses are required to receive the PhD. In their first year, most students are required to take the methods sequence (271A-B-C) and the theory sequence (201A-B). Students who receive special consideration may fulfill all or part of the Methods requirements through a combination of exams, exercises, and/or written work. This option is discouraged because the 271A-B–C sequence is unlike similar sequences offered elsewhere. Students without a previous MA who are exempted from a methods course still need to complete an alternate course in its place. </p>
<p>Additional course requirements include two 280s (pre-MA, introductions to subfields), one 273 (post-MA) advanced methods course, and three additional elective courses. Some recommended courses are SOCIOL 202s (advanced theory), additional 280s or 290 (special topics). In addition, two graduate-level, sociologically relevant, 3 or 4 unit courses are allowed from a department outside Sociology.  A minimum of 35 units is required to complete the PhD program.  Finally, no more than two substantive, letter-graded independent study 299s are allowed toward the 11-course PhD requirement. </p>
<h4>Students Entering with an MA</h4>
<p>Students who enter the program with an MA must meet with the director of graduate studies during their first semester in the department to work out an acceptable program of study. Normally, students who enter with an MA take the five courses required of students seeking the MA at Berkeley (i.e., Sociology 201A, 201B, 271A, 271B, and 271C) or petition for special consideration as described above. Most students also take two other courses (280s). Students who are exempted from one or more of these required courses must still take a minimum of three courses at the MA level.</p>

<h3>Normative Time Requirements</h3>
<h4 class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Normative Time to Advancement</h4>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Normative time to advancement is the end of the fourth year (eighth semester) in the program. Normative time to complete the masters paper is the fifth semester in the program (must also have completed eight of the eleven required courses before this time). Normative time to complete the qualifying examinations is seventh semester in the program (must also have completed the eleven required courses before this time).</p>
<h4>Normative Time in Candidacy</h4>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Normative time in doctoral candidacy is two years.</p>
<h4 class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Total Normative Time</h4>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Total normative time is six years.</p>
<h3>Pre-Candidacy Academic Milestones</h3>
<h4 class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Master’s Paper</h4>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">The department requires students to write a master’s paper to receive the MA degree. This paper needs to be approved by an MA committee composed of two to three faculty members. Sometimes these research papers begin as coursework, but the finished product is significantly more developed than a typical term paper.</p>
<h4 class="Normal1CxSpLast">Qualifying Examination</h4>
<p>The purpose of the qualifying examination is to ascertain the breadth of the student’s comprehension of fundamental facts and principles that apply to theory and at least two subfields of sociology. It also determines whether the student has the ability to think incisively and critically about the theoretical and practical aspects of these subfields.</p>
<h4 class="Normal1CxSpLast">Prospectus</h4>
<p>The dissertation prospectus is the last requirement that graduate students must meet before advancing to candidacy. The prospectus is a description of the proposed dissertation research. Through the prospectus, students articulate the topic and research question that motivates the dissertation research; explain why this question is of importance to the relevant fields of study; and describe as thoroughly and succinctly as possible their research design.</p>
<h3>Time in Candidacy</h3>
<h4 class="Normal1CxSpFirst">Dissertation</h4>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">The student assembles a committee that generally consists of two regular sociology faculty, one of whom will serve as chair, as well as one regular member from another department at Berkeley. The research project is carried out and analyzed in dissertation form. Most dissertations go through several drafts. Once the committee members accept the final draft, the work is signed and submitted to the Graduate Division as complete. There is no formal defense of the completed dissertation.</p>
<h3>Required Professional Development</h3>
<h4>Proseminar</h4>
<p>First-year students attend <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOCIOL%20200" title="SOCIOL 200" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOCIOL 200');">SOCIOL 200</a></span>. This proseminar offers an introduction to the faculty and the discipline as well as advice about completing the requirements of the program.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="teachingopportunitiestextcontainer" class="page_content tab_content" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="teachingopportunitiestexttab" >
				<a name="teachingopportunitiestext"></a><h2>Teaching Opportunities</h2><p>Students are encouraged to teach during their graduate study in the program as part of their professional training. A significant number of our undergraduate courses offer graduate student instructor (GSI) positions. The department offers training for our new GSIs through our pedagogy course (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOCIOL%20375" title="SOCIOL 375" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOCIOL 375');">SOCIOL 375</a></span>). New GSIs are required to attend the <a href="http://gsi.berkeley.edu/programs-services/conference/" target="_blank">Teaching Conference for First-Time GSIs</a> each year and are encouraged to attend further offerings through the GSI Teaching &amp; Resource Center on campus, including their Certificate Program in Teaching and Learning in Higher Education.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="professionaldevelopmentactivitiestextcontainer" class="page_content tab_content" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="professionaldevelopmentactivitiestexttab" >
				<a name="professionaldevelopmentactivitiestext"></a><h2>Professional Development Activities</h2><h3>Colloquium</h3>
<p>Students are strongly encouraged to attend the sociology colloquium series. The departmental colloquium is generally a who’s who of contemporary sociology. Attending these talks is a very efficient and lively way of getting an overview of the discipline. It is also a means by which students are introduced to the profession.</p>
<h3>Workshops</h3>
<p class="Normal1CxSpFirst">The department offers a variety of workshops (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOCIOL%20292" title="SOCIOL 292" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOCIOL 292');">SOCIOL 292</a></span>) each semester which is formed in collaboration with faculty and interested students. Topics cover a variety of subfields and topics, such as immigration, race, economic sociology, gender, archival methods, qualitative data analysis as well as mathematical, analytical and experimental sociology. New workshops are often arranged according to student interests.</p>
<h3>Professional Conference Attendance and Presentation</h3>
<p class="Normal1">Each year our students attend and present at conferences relevant to their research interests, including the American Sociological Conference and the International Sociological Conference, among others.</p>
<h3>Job Market Workshops </h3>
<p>Our PhD students have been extraordinarily successful in obtaining research and teaching positions in research-oriented universities as well as more teaching-oriented colleges. A smaller but significant number have pursued careers in research institutes, business, government, and nonprofits.</p>
<p>To prepare for the current job market, we encourage students to produce publishable research papers early in their studies, master both quantitative and/or qualitative research techniques, and gain relevant teaching experience. Students also benefit from presenting their own research in department workshops and at professional conferences.</p>

Social Theory began as an attempt to come to grips with the massive social transformations in Europe beginning around 1500. Modernity was understood in three ways. It concerned the development of a capitalist economy based on the use of science to develop new technology, the emergence of states with bureaucracies allied with military organizations, and the decline of religious authority as the main arbiter of moral values accompanied by the rise</span><span class="deschide"> of the model of the self-interested purposive actor. Social theory was produced not just to create an understanding of these changes and the problems they caused, but also to be used to propose how society ought to be structured. In this class, we examine how classical thinkers, like Karl Marx, Max Weber, and Emile Durkheim among others, proposed how to analyze those changes and in doing so created theories of society.</span><br/>

This course is a continuation of our required graduate theory course. We separate modern and classical social theory by considering modern social theory to consist of works published after World War II. Modern sociological theory uses classical social theory both as a source and a foil. There have been continuities in social thought whereby more contemporary theorists view themselves as using elements of classical social theory, sometimes</span><span class="deschide"> in combination and at other times to understand different kinds of phenomena, such as micro-interaction or gender relations. Contemporary theory has also been critical of classical theory. This has caused different theorists to construct entirely new ideas or rely on new sources for their theories. The course considers a wide variety of authors and perspectives to illustrate the current breadth of social thought.</span><br/>

In this graduate-level research methods course we will revisit and extend many of the issues with<br/>
which you have dealt in conducting your MA and possibly other research. Further, some issues<br/>
that bear on your (and everyone’s) research will be brought into our discussion. As we revisit,<br/>
extend, and broaden the material of methods, students can use their research experience to<br/>
interrogate the conflicting ideas of the course</span><span class="deschide">, and use various conflicting ideas of the course to<br/>
interrogate (and enhance the quality of) their research.</span><br/>

Poverty is part of the social stratification system as well as a condition with properties that characterize the individual living with extreme material scarcity. Thus, it involves both the social and the physical world. The course will engage a broad literature on poverty that incorporates research from sociology, economics, and anthropology.</span><span class="deschide"> We also will consider structure, culture, and agency in creating and maintaining individuals and groups in the condition of poverty.</span><br/>

We’re in the midst of a climate emergency, with climate change the most pressing problem. We need to transform our social and economic system to avoid the worst. There's still time to do this, while establishing the conditions for us, and our descendants, to live brilliant, stimulating lives. To move forward, we need to supplement natural science with social science. This course is a survey of key research topics in climate and environmental sociology tuned to the</span><span class="deschide"> pressing effort to understand the core social (and political, and economic) dimensions of this crisis, and the extent to which these are (or are not) novel dynamics. Put another way: how much continuity, and how much change, is there in the climate emergency?</span><br/>

The seminar focuses on processes of incorporation--economic, social, cultural, and political--but we also look at paradigms that challenge an integrationist reading of migration, in particular transnationalism and models of postnational citizenship.</span><br/>
